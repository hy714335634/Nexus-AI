  "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a key member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, plays a significant role in drug absorption and distribution by binding to diverse xenobiotics and actively transporting them out of cells. Given P-gp's widespread expression, including its critical presence at the blood–brain barrier, identifying whether a compound functions as a P-gp substrate or inhibitor is essential in drug development to evaluate its ability to penetrate the central nervous system. However, most studies on P-gp focus on inhibitor models rather than substrate models. This study presents a robust graph neural network approach to predict P-gp substrates, leveraging graph convolutional networks, AttentiveFP, and an ensemble model. Using a dataset of 1995 drug molecules (1202 substrates, 793 nonsubstrates), AttentiveFP outperformed traditional methods, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.848 and an accuracy of 0.815. Integrated gradient analysis identified 20 key substructures associated with P-gp substrates. Most noteworthy is that the top four conferring a >70% probability of substrate classification which can be used a quick assessment in the future.

  "title": "SolPredictor: Predicting Solubility with Residual Gated Graph Neural Network",
  "abstract": "Computational methods play a pivotal role in the pursuit of efficient drug discovery, enabling the rapid assessment of compound properties before costly and time-consuming laboratory experiments. With the advent of technology and large data availability, machine and deep learning methods have proven efficient in predicting molecular solubility. High-precision in silico solubility prediction has revolutionized drug development by enhancing formulation design, guiding lead optimization, and predicting pharmacokinetic parameters. These benefits result in considerable cost and time savings, resulting in a more efficient and shortened drug development process. The proposed SolPredictor is designed with the aim of developing a computational model for solubility prediction. The model is based on residual graph neural network convolution (RGNN). The RGNNs were designed to capture long-range dependencies in graph-structured data. Residual connections enable information to be utilized over various layers, allowing the model to capture and preserve essential features and patterns scattered throughout the network. The two largest datasets available to date are compiled, and the model uses a simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) representation. SolPredictor uses the ten-fold split cross-validation Pearson correlation coefficient R2 0.79±0.02 and root mean square error (RMSE) 1.03±0.04. The proposed model was evaluated using five independent datasets. Error analysis, hyperparameter optimization analysis, and model explainability were used to determine the molecular features that were most valuable for prediction.",

  "title": "Advancing ADMET prediction through multiscale fragment-aware pretraining with MSformer-ADMET",
  "abstract": "Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties are critical determinants of the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of drug candidates. Accurate and early-stage prediction of ADMET characteristics is essential for reducing late-stage attrition rates, lowering development costs, and accelerating the drug discovery process. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great promise in molecular property prediction, especially with the emergence of Transformer-based architectures that can effectively model long-range dependencies in molecular representations. However, most existing methods rely heavily on atom-level encodings (e.g. smiles or molecular graphs), which often lack structural interpretability and generalization across heterogeneous tasks. Previously, we developed a de novo and flexible molecular representation framework named MSformer (available at https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/MSformer), which demonstrated success in bioactivity prediction. We have now adapted and specialized this architecture for ADMET property prediction. This adapted implementation, designated as MSformer-ADMET, extends the framework's capabilities to pharmacokinetic and toxicity endpoints while maintaining its flexible, fragmentation-based approach to molecular representation learning. MSformer-ADMET is fine-tuned on 22 tasks collected from the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), covering both classification and regression settings. Results demonstrate that MSformer-ADMET achieves superior performance across a wide range of ADMET endpoints, consistently outperforming conventional smiles-based and graph-based models. Notably, we further conducted interpretability analyses by leveraging the model's attention distributions and fragment-to-atom mappings, allowing the identification of key structural fragments that are highly associated with molecular properties. This post hoc interpretability provides more transparent insights into the structure–property relationship. Collectively, results demonstrate that MSformer-ADMET is a highly effective and broadly applicable model for ADMET prediction.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET", "transformer", "deep learning", "meta structure", "natural products", "drug discovery"],
  "methods": "MSformer-ADMET adopts the MSformer architecture with three key functional modules: (i) a meta-structure encoder for capturing hierarchical chemical patterns, (ii) a structural feature extractor for learning discriminative molecular representations, and (iii) a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for endpoint-specific predictions. The model converts each query molecule into a set of corresponding meta-structures, which are then encoded into fixed-length embeddings using a pretrained encoder. Global average pooling (GAP) is applied to aggregate fragment-level features into molecule-level representations. The framework employs a pretraining-finetuning strategy, where MSformer-ADMET was pretrained on 234 million representative structure data and then fine-tuned on 22 datasets from the TDC. The model incorporates a multihead parallel MLP structure to support multitask learning and uses early stopping strategy to prevent overfitting.",
  "results": "MSformer-ADMET achieved superior performance across 22 ADMET tasks from TDC, ranking first in 11 tasks and top two in 17 tasks among all compared models. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed MSformer-ADMET significantly outperformed six out of eight baseline models (P < 0.05), including Mamba, Morgan + MLP, GCN, NeuralFP, HFST, and Chemprop. The model achieved the best average rank (2.611) among all models, followed by CFA (3.111) and Chemprop (4.222). Ablation studies revealed that replacing fragment embeddings with smiles-level embeddings led to 26.04% performance degradation on regression tasks and 3.38% decrease on classification tasks. Removing pretraining resulted in 3.43% decline on regression tasks and 4.75% on classification tasks. The model demonstrated strong interpretability through attention-based fragment analysis, showing that attention weights correlated with molecular weight and structural importance.",
  "conclusions": "MSformer-ADMET provides a novel and effective paradigm for ADMET modeling with significant implications for enhancing early-stage safety assessment and candidate prioritization in drug discovery pipelines. By incorporating chemically meaningful meta-structures and modeling their contextual relationships through a cascaded Transformer architecture, the approach effectively enhances molecular semantic representation. The model demonstrates strong generalization, adaptability to multitask learning, and resilience in low-resource settings. Its interpretability module enables fragment-level analysis of predictive outcomes, providing mechanistic insights into structure–property relationships and supporting rational optimization in drug discovery workflows.",

  "abstract": "Objective: The development of pharmaceutical agents relies heavily on optimizing their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological properties, collectively known as ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). Accurate assessment of these properties during the early stages of drug development is challenging due to resource-intensive experimental evaluation and limited comprehensive data availability. To overcome these obstacles, there has been a growing reliance on computational and predictive tools, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning and graph-based methodologies. This study presents an innovative approach that harnesses the power of optimal transport (OT) theory to construct three graph kernels for predicting drug ADMET properties. This approach involves the use of graph matching to create a similarity matrix, which is subsequently integrated into a predictive model. Results: Through extensive evaluations on 19 distinct ADMET datasets, the potential of this methodology becomes evident. The OT-based graph kernels exhibits exceptional performance, outperforming state-of-the-art graph deep learning models in 9 out of 19 datasets, even surpassing the most impactful Graph Neural Network (GNN) that excels in 4 datasets. Furthermore, they are very competitive in 2 additional datasets. Conclusion: Our proposed novel class of OT-based graph kernels not only demonstrates a high degree of effectiveness and competitiveness but also, in contrast to graph neural networks, offers interpretability, adaptability and generalizability across multiple datasets.",

Our approach unfolds across successive stages: (1) transformation of each drug molecule into an assembly of node embeddings based on the atomic properties of the compound, (2) quantifying the Wasserstein distance between all graph pairs, and (3) creation of a similarity matrix that to be utilized within the learning algorithm. We constructed the cost matrix by calculating the Euclidean distance between the features at the nodes of the drug pairs. This cost matrix is employed in the optimization problem to match the two distributions. Derived from the graph W/GW/FGW distances, a similarity matrix can be formulated to be utilized into a learning algorithm. For the classification task, we utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel Multi Layer Perception using the indefinite kernel matrix. For the regression task, we used Support Vector Regression (SVR) and different architecture of Kernel Multi Layer Perception. We utilized a scaffold split to replicate this distant influence. The data are partitioned into a 7:1:2 ratio for the training, validation, and test sets, with the training and validation sets being scaffold shuffled five times to generate five independent runs.",
  "results": "Our proposed models, especially W- and FGW-based frameworks, demonstrate significantly improved performance relative to current state-of-the-art graph-based techniques and various deep learning models across 9 distinct datasets. Moreover, our methods ranked among the top three methods in 11 out of 19 datasets. The most impactful baseline method, the GNN employing context prediction masking (CPred), performs the best on three datasets. Several deep learning methods, including CNN and MLP based on Morgan fingerprints, did not yield the best results in any of the datasets. The performance of our proposed method was particularly noticeable in predicting properties related to metabolism, distribution, and toxicity. The three methods based on OT kernels exhibited diverse performance, with the GW method unexpectedly demonstrating the lowest performance among the three methods. The model based on FGW outperformed the other two, and the Wasserstein-based model was generally somewhere in between. For the GW and FGW-based kernels, obtaining distances was computationally prohibitive and infeasible for large datasets, namely: Lipo, AqSol, BBB, AMES, and LD50.",
  "conclusions": "Our innovative approach, harnessing optimal transport (OT) theory to formulate a graph kernel for predicting drug ADMET properties, demonstrates substantial potential and overall competitiveness compared to existing state-of-the-art methodologies. Notably, the model showcases remarkable adaptability and generalization capabilities, suggesting its capacity to significantly enhance pharmaceutical development. This study marks a significant advancement in the integration of machine learning and graph-based methodologies for the early assessment of drug properties, offering insights that pave the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug development processes. Future endeavors will focus on further developing OT-based methods to address intricate challenges in drug discovery, encompassing aspects such as protein-protein interactions, drug-drug interactions, and drug-target interactions.",

  "abstract": "Understanding Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-mediated metabolism is critical for accurate Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) predictions, which play a pivotal role in drug discovery. Traditional approaches, while foundational, often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and translatability. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of how graph-based computational techniques, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex CYP enzyme interactions and predicting ADMET properties with improved precision. Focusing on key CYP isoforms-CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4-we synthesize current research advancements and methodologies, emphasizing the integration of multi-task learning, attention mechanisms, and explainable AI (XAI) in enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of ADMET predictions. Furthermore, we address ongoing challenges, such as dataset variability and the generalization of models to novel chemical spaces. The review concludes by identifying future research opportunities, particularly in improving scalability, incorporating real-time experimental validation, and expanding focus on enzyme-specific interactions. These insights underscore the transformative potential of graph-based approaches in advancing drug development and optimizing safety evaluations.",

  "methods": "Our literature review followed a structured approach to identify relevant studies from 2019 to 2024. The databases chosen for our search were Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selected for their specific strengths and coverage. Google Scholar provided a broad and extensive collection of scholarly articles, including grey literature and conference papers, offering a comprehensive view of the field. PubMed, a key database for biomedical literature, was crucial for its focused collection of life sciences and biomedical research, ensuring we captured relevant studies specifically related to ADMET and CYP enzymes. Scopus was included for its wide multidisciplinary coverage and excellent tools for citation analysis, aiding in the identification of influential and highly cited works in the domain of graph-based methods in drug discovery. The queries were designed to capture a broad spectrum of articles related to ADMET prediction for the major isoforms of CYP enzymes, utilizing graph-based modeling techniques. Searches across Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus yielded a combined total of 2,524 articles. Our two-stage screening involved title/abstract analysis for relevance, followed by full-text review for studies specifically using graph-based methods.",
  "results": "Recent advances in ADMET prediction have been categorized into four key areas: GNNs and GCNs, XAI and interpretable graph-based models, multi-task learning with GNNs, and hybrid modeling approaches. GNNs and GCNs have emerged as powerful tools for predicting ADMET properties, with models like Chemi-Net, gTPP, and DeepCYPs demonstrating high predictive performance across major CYP isoforms. The gTPP model achieved 90% validity and 55% efficiency across endpoints, with CYP2C9 and 2D6 accuracy improvements of +53% and +74% respectively compared to commercial tools. Multi-task learning frameworks like ADMETLab 2.0 achieved high AUCs for CYP inhibition (e.g., CYP1A2: 0.928, CYP2C9: 0.919, CYP3A4: 0.921), while substrate predictions were less accurate. XAI techniques using integrated gradients and attention mechanisms provided interpretable molecular coloring visualizations, with models achieving AUROC values ranging from 0.85 to 0.979 across different CYP isoforms. Hybrid approaches combining graph-based methods with molecular fingerprints demonstrated superior performance, with some models achieving top-1 performance in 11/22 benchmarks and top-3 in 19/22 benchmarks on Therapeutics Data Commons datasets.",
  "conclusions": "Recent advances in graph-based modeling have significantly enhanced ADMET prediction, particularly for major CYP450 isoforms such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. The integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and attention-based mechanisms has not only improved predictive performance, but also contributed to greater interpretability in modeling enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor interactions. Despite these advancements, challenges remain including data imbalance, inconsistent annotations, and limited experimental validation. Future research should prioritize expanding and harmonizing datasets to improve chemical diversity and enzyme representation, developing enzyme-specific models that distinguish between substrates and inhibitors for each isoform, establishing standardized benchmarks and interpretability metrics, incorporating experimental validation into model training workflows, and embracing multimodal learning architectures that integrate omics data, molecular structure, and individual variability. Graph-based ADMET modeling, when coupled with comprehensive datasets and mechanistic insights, has the potential to revolutionize early-stage drug development and enable safer, more effective, and personalized therapeutic strategies.",

  "title": "Prediction of Drug-Drug Interaction Using an Attention-Based Graph Neural Network on Drug Molecular Graphs",
  "abstract": "The treatment of complex diseases by using multiple drugs has become popular. However, drug-drug interactions (DDI) may give rise to the risk of unanticipated adverse effects and even unknown toxicity. Therefore, for polypharmacy safety it is crucial to identify DDIs and explore their underlying mechanisms. The detection of DDI in the wet lab is expensive and time-consuming, due to the need for experimental research over a large volume of drug combinations. Although many computational methods have been developed to predict DDIs, most of these are incapable of predicting potential DDIs between drugs within the DDI network and new drugs from outside the DDI network. In addition, they are not designed to explore the underlying mechanisms of DDIs and lack interpretative capacity. Thus, here we propose a novel method of GNN-DDI to predict potential DDIs by constructing a five-layer graph attention network to identify k-hops low-dimensional feature representations for each drug from its chemical molecular graph, concatenating all identified features of each drug pair, and inputting them into a MLP predictor to obtain the final DDI prediction score. The experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-DDI is suitable for each of two DDI predicting scenarios, namely the potential DDIs among known drugs in the DDI network and those between drugs within the DDI network and new drugs from outside DDI network. The case study indicates that our method can explore the specific drug substructures that lead to the potential DDIs, which helps to improve interpretability and discover the underlying interaction mechanisms of drug pairs.",
  "keywords": ["drug-drug interaction", "prediction", "feature representation", "molecular graph", "graph attention network"],
  "methods": "We built a DDI dataset containing 1,935 drugs and 589,827 annotated drug-drug interactions from DrugBank 5.0. Drug molecular graphs were created using SMILES strings and RDKit library, with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. Each node contained a 78-dim initial feature vector including atom symbol, adjacent atoms, valence, formal charge, radical electrons, hybridization, hydrogen bonds, and aromaticity. GNN-DDI consists of two modules: a drug feature extractor using five-layer graph attention network (GAT) and a DDI predictor using multi-layer perception (MLP). The GAT learns k-hops low-dimensional feature representations from molecular graphs using attention mechanisms to weight neighborhood information. SAGPooling transforms atomic feature matrices to drug feature vectors. Features from all five layers are concatenated as final drug representations. Drug pairs are represented by concatenating individual drug features and fed into a five-layer MLP predictor with ReLU activation and SoftMax output.",
  "results": "GNN-DDI achieved superior performance in both prediction scenarios. In the first scenario (predicting interactions among known drugs), GNN-DDI outperformed five state-of-the-art methods with improvements of 8.5~22.9% in AUPR, 8.9~66.8% in recall, 13.2~42.5% in precision, 9.4~57% in accuracy, and 11.8~53.5% in F1 score. The method achieved AUC of 0.936, AUPR of 0.930, recall of 0.920, precision of 0.823, accuracy of 0.863, and F1 of 0.869. In the second scenario (predicting interactions between known and new drugs), GNN-DDI outperformed four chemical and biological feature-based methods. The molecular structure features learned by GNN-DDI achieved improvements of 0.6~4.8% in AUC, 0.2~5.5% in AUPR, and 0.4~11.7% in recall compared to PubChem fingerprint, MACCSkeys fingerprint, DBP, and ATC features.",
  "conclusions": "GNN-DDI successfully addresses the limitations of current DDI prediction methods by enabling prediction for new drugs and providing interpretability. The five-layer GAT effectively captures different kth-order substructure functional groups through multi-step operations, generating effective drug feature representations. The method demonstrates superior performance in both DDI prediction scenarios and shows that features learned directly from chemical molecular graphs outperform traditional fingerprint and biological features. The case study with Sildenafil and nitrate-based drugs demonstrates that GNN-DDI can identify specific drug substructures contributing to interactions, improving interpretability and revealing underlying interaction mechanisms.",

  "title": "Could graph neural networks learn better molecular representation for drug discovery? A comparison study of descriptor-based and graph-based models",
  "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) has been considered as an attractive modelling method for molecular property prediction, and numerous studies have shown that GNN could yield more promising results than traditional descriptor-based methods. In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles. All in all, we believe that the off-the-shelf descriptor-based models still can be directly employed to accurately predict various chemical endpoints with excellent computability and interpretability.",
  "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "Extreme gradient boosting", "Ensemble learning", "Deep learning", "ADME/T prediction"],
  "methods": "To well compare the performance of descriptor-based and graph-based models, the dataset collection related to drug discovery used by Attentive FP was adopted, containing 11 different datasets originally reported in MoleculeNet for various chemical endpoints. Four ML algorithms were used to develop descriptor-based models: SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN. The combination of 206 MOE 1-D and 2-D descriptors, 881 PubChem fingerprints and 307 substructure fingerprints were used as molecular representations. Four graph-based models were employed: GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP, using informationized molecular graphs with atom-level and bond-level features as input. The Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE) algorithm was used for hyperparameter optimization in 50 evaluations. To alleviate the effect of randomness in data splitting, 50 independent runs with different random seeds were performed for each ML model with training/validation/test ratios of 8:1:1. Classification models were evaluated by AUC-ROC (AUC-PRC for MUV dataset), and regression models by RMSE. Multi-task learning was applied for NN-based models on multi-task datasets.",
  "results": "The results demonstrate that on average descriptor-based models outperform graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. For regression tasks, SVM achieved the best predictions on ESOL (RMSE=0.569±0.052) and FreeSolv (RMSE=0.852±0.171), while Attentive FP performed best on Lipop (RMSE=0.553±0.035). For classification tasks, descriptor-based models were superior on BBBP (average AUC-ROC=0.924 vs 0.891 for graph-based) and BACE (0.891 vs 0.875). However, graph-based models showed advantages on larger datasets like HIV, where GCN achieved AUC-ROC=0.834±0.025. For multi-task datasets, Attentive FP achieved best performance on Tox21 (AUC-ROC=0.852±0.012) and ToxCast (AUC-ROC=0.794±0.017). In terms of computational efficiency, XGBoost and RF were most efficient, requiring only seconds for training even on large datasets, while graph-based models required significantly more computational time. The top three models across all datasets were mainly occupied by descriptor-based models (24/33 = 73%).",
  "conclusions": "The study illustrates that descriptor-based models are able to achieve better or comparable predictions to highly-intricate and specialized graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy, computability and interpretability. SVM generally gives the best predictions to regression tasks, while both XGBoost and RF can give reliable predictions to classification tasks. Graph-based methods such as GCN and Attentive FP can offer outstanding performance on larger or multi-task datasets. XGBoost and RF have fast computability and descriptor-based models can be well interpreted by the SHAP method. The off-the-shelf descriptor-based models still can be directly employed to accurately predict various chemical endpoints with excellent computability and interpretability, challenging the common belief that graph-based methods are superior for molecular property prediction.",

  "title": "Activity Cliff-Informed Contrastive Learning for Molecular Property Prediction",
  "abstract": "Modeling molecular activity and quantitative structure-activity relationships of chemical compounds is critical in drug design. Graph neural networks, which utilize molecular structures as frames, have shown success in assessing the biological activity of chemical compounds, guiding the selection and optimization of candidates for further development. However, current models often overlook activity cliffs (ACs)—cases where structurally similar molecules exhibit different bioactivities—due to latent spaces primarily optimized for structural features. Here, we introduce AC-awareness (ACA), an inductive bias designed to enhance molecular representation learning for activity modeling. The ACA jointly optimizes metric learning in the latent space and task performance in the target space, making models more sensitive to ACs. We develop ACANet, an AC-informed contrastive learning approach that can be integrated with any graph neural network. Experiments on 39 benchmark datasets demonstrate that AC-informed representations of chemical compounds consistently outperform standard models in bioactivity prediction across both regression and classification tasks. AC-informed models show strong performance in predicting pharmacokinetic and safety-relevant molecular properties. ACA paves the way toward activity-informed molecular representations, providing a valuable tool for the early stages of lead compound identification, refinement, and virtual screening.",
  "keywords": ["Activity Cliff", "Contrastive Learning", "Activity Cliff Awareness", "Graph neural networks"],
  "methods": "We introduce activity cliff awareness (AC-awareness), a novel inductive bias for GNN models designed to improve molecular activity prediction. AC-awareness enhances the model's ability and sensitivity to distinguish structurally similar molecules with differing activities by optimizing the latent space to reflect these critical activity differences. Our approach optimizes the latent feature space to address discontinuities in structure-activity relationships (SAR) within the feature space, avoiding fragmented feature distributions. This is achieved by integrating a novel Activity Cliff Awareness (ACA) loss function, which combines a standard regression loss (e.g., MAE or MSE) with a triplet soft margin (TSM) loss. The TSM loss penalizes the model when the relative distances in the latent space between an anchor compound and its corresponding positive and negative compounds in high-value activity cliff triplets (HV-ACTs) do not reflect their activity relationships. To identify HV-ACTs, we introduce two parameters: cliff lower (cl) and cliff upper (cu). These parameters define the range of activity differences used to sample potential triplets during training, ensuring that the model focuses on the most informative triplets—those that challenge its ability to capture both activity differences and similarities.",
  "results": "Experiments on nine LSSNS datasets and 30 higher-sample size and mixed scaffold (HSSMS) activity benchmark datasets demonstrate that incorporating AC-awareness can improve model performance by an average of 7.16% and 6.59%, respectively. Furthermore, AC-informed ACANET models outperform molecular fingerprint-based models on 70%−76% of the HSSMS benchmark datasets. On the low-sample size and narrow scaffold (LSSNS) BRAF dataset, the model with AC-awareness improved label coherence in the latent space by 31.4% compared to the model without AC-awareness. This enhancement translated into average performance improvements of 7.54% and 21.6% over baseline models using MAE and MSE regression losses, respectively. For ADMET property prediction, ACANET demonstrated comparable performance to ChemProp and DeepDelta on the three absorption datasets, despite the more challenging task of predicting absolute ADMET property values. Moreover, ACANET achieved the lowest cross-validation RMSE across all other seven DMET datasets—two distribution datasets, one excretion dataset, three metabolism datasets, and one toxicity dataset.",
  "conclusions": "Our results showed that during model training, the standard regression loss cannot optimize HV-ACTs in the latent space, as evidenced by the fact that the number of HV-ACTs does not decrease during training. However, when AC-awareness is infused into the model, it effectively addresses this limitation by gradually reducing the number of mined HV-ACTs. This enhancement allows the model to become more sensitive, enabling it to better distinguish between structurally similar molecules with vastly different activities and recognize similarities between structurally different molecules with comparable activities. The comprehensive benchmark results showed that GNN models using MAE loss with AC-awareness significantly outperform those without AC-awareness on both low-sample LSSNS and higher-sample HSSMS datasets, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.59% to 7.16%. This consistently strong performance across diverse dataset types underscores the robustness of AC-awareness in enhancing model activity predictions, regardless of dataset size or scaffold diversity.",

Here, we summarize the cardiotoxicity and general toxicity profiles of 90 potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment and outline the risks of repurposing and propose a stratification of patients accordingly. We shortlist a total of five compounds based on their non-toxic properties. This manuscript aims to provide a potentially useful source of essential knowledge on toxicity assessment of 90 compounds for healthcare practitioners and researchers to find off-label alternatives for the treatment for COVID-19.",

ADMET Predictor accepts 2D/3D-dimensional SDF files of the structures of the compounds as input. Then, compounds can be mathematically codified to more than 350 molecular descriptors. Molecular descriptors are used to create prediction models using statistical approaches or machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and the artificial neural network (ANN). The 'bottom-up' approach taken in ADMET Predictor creates a separate model for each of the ten constituent assays, then combines the results into an overall toxicity risk.

  "abstract": "The integration of multi-omics data from diverse high-throughput technologies has revolutionized drug discovery. While various network-based methods have been developed to integrate multi-omics data, systematic evaluation and comparison of these methods remain challenging. This review aims to analyze network-based approaches for multi-omics integration and evaluate their applications in drug discovery. We conducted a comprehensive review of literature (2015–2024) on network-based multi-omics integration methods in drug discovery, and categorized methods into four primary types: network propagation/diffusion, similarity-based approaches, graph neural networks, and network inference models. We also discussed the applications of the methods in three scenario of drug discovery, including drug target identification, drug response prediction, and drug repurposing, and finally evaluated the performance of the methods by highlighting their advantages and limitations in specific applications. While network-based multi-omics integration has shown promise in drug discovery, challenges remain in computational scalability, data integration, and biological interpretation. Future developments should focus on incorporating temporal and spatial dynamics, improving model interpretability, and establishing standardized evaluation frameworks.",

  "methods": "Our comprehensive review focused on network-based multi-omics integration methods in drug discovery published between January 2015 and December 2024. The literature collection process employed a three-tiered strategy combining systematic database searching, expert recommendations, and citation network analysis. We conducted systematic searches across major scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplorer. The search strategy utilized carefully constructed combinations of key terms: (\"multi-omics\" OR \"multiomics\" OR \"omics fusion\") AND (\"network analysis\" OR \"biological network\" OR \"biological interaction\") AND (\"drug discovery\" OR \"drug prediction\" OR \"drug development\"). Studies were included if they: (1) presented original research developing or significantly improving network-based methods for multi-omics integration; (2) demonstrated clear applications in drug discovery or drug response prediction; (3) provided performance evaluation using standard metrics; (4) utilized multiple types of omics data (minimum of two omics layers); and (5) incorporated biological network information in their analytical framework.",
  "results": "Through our comprehensive analysis of literature published between 2015 and 2024, we identified and evaluated 21 methods/tools that employed network-based multi-omics integration in drug discovery from a total of 265 candidates. We categorized three primary application domains: drug target identification and validation (19%), drug response prediction and personalized medicine (58%), and drug repurposing and combination therapy design (23%). We categorized network-based integration methods into four main types: network propagation/diffusion (21%), similarity-based methods (19%), network-based inference methods (24%), and artificial neural networks (36%). Representative methods include SynGeNet for drug combination prediction, AOPEDF for drug-target interaction prediction, CancerOmicsNet for drug response prediction using graph neural networks, and DIVERSE for Bayesian matrix factorization-based drug response prediction. Performance evaluation showed that hybrid approaches combining multiple methodologies often achieved superior results compared to single-method approaches.",
  "conclusions": "Network-based multi-omics integration represents a powerful paradigm in drug discovery, enabling more accurate predictions of drug responses and identification of novel therapeutic targets. While significant progress has been made in improving prediction accuracy and biological interpretability, critical challenges persist in handling data heterogeneity, computational scalability, and standardization of evaluation frameworks. Future developments should prioritize several key areas: the integration of temporal and spatial dynamics into network models, enhancement of model interpretability without sacrificing predictive power, development of scalable algorithms for massive-scale multi-omics datasets, and establishment of standardized evaluation frameworks. Success in addressing these challenges will be crucial for translating computational insights into actionable clinical applications, ultimately advancing the field of precision medicine and drug development.",

## Deep Analysis of Literature Relevance to ADMET Prediction Research

### 1. Core Relevance Assessment

**Primary Finding**: This literature shows **LOW direct relevance** to ADMET prediction research despite being within the temporal scope (2022 publication).

**Key Disconnects**:
- **Topic Mismatch**: The paper focuses on general biomedical data analysis applications rather than drug discovery/ADMET-specific applications
- **Application Gap**: Discusses medical imaging and diagnostics, not molecular property prediction
- **Methodological Generality**: Covers neural network architectures broadly without ADMET-specific adaptations

### 2. Structured Relevance Scoring

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Direct Topic Alignment** | 1/5 | No mention of ADMET, drug discovery, or molecular properties |
| **Methodological Relevance** | 3/5 | Neural networks are applicable to ADMET, but no specific adaptations discussed |
| **Temporal Relevance** | 5/5 | 2022 publication fits "recent 5 years" criteria |
| **Innovation Value** | 1/5 | No novel insights for ADMET prediction field |
| **Practical Utility** | 2/5 | General neural network knowledge has limited direct application |

**Overall Relevance Score: 2.4/5 (Low-Medium)**

### 3. Critical Implications

**For Literature Review Strategy**:
- This represents a **false positive** in search results
- Indicates need for more specific search terms (e.g., "molecular property prediction", "drug discovery", "pharmacokinetics")
- Suggests current search strategy may be too broad

**For ADMET Research Context**:
- While neural networks are fundamental to modern ADMET prediction, this paper doesn't advance the field
- The general architectures discussed (CNN, RNN, GNN, Transformers) are indeed used in ADMET tools, but without domain-specific insights
- Missing critical ADMET-specific considerations like molecular representation, chemical feature engineering, and pharmacological endpoints

### 4. Actionable Conclusions

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Exclude** this paper from the ADMET literature review
2. **Refine search strategy** to include ADMET-specific terms:
   - "ADMET prediction" + "deep learning"
   - "Molecular property prediction" + "neural networks"
   - "Pharmacokinetics" + "machine learning"
   - "Drug discovery" + "AI/ML"

**Strategic Insights**:
- Focus on papers that explicitly address molecular-level predictions
- Prioritize literature from computational chemistry and drug discovery journals

# Deep Analytical Processing: Literature Relevance Assessment for ADMET Prediction Research

**Analysis Timestamp**: 2025-10-27T09:21:12.058935+00:00  
**Processing Cycle**: 2/3  
**Analysis Depth**: Advanced Strategic Assessment

## 1. Meta-Analytical Framework Development

### Critical Pattern Recognition
The previous cycle's analysis reveals a **fundamental methodological challenge** in ADMET literature curation: the **semantic gap** between general AI/ML applications and domain-specific molecular prediction tasks. This represents a broader issue in interdisciplinary research where technological advances don't automatically translate to domain expertise.

### Hierarchical Relevance Model
I propose a **three-tier relevance assessment framework**:

**Tier 1 (Direct Relevance)**: Papers explicitly addressing ADMET prediction with molecular-specific methodologies
**Tier 2 (Methodological Relevance)**: Papers presenting novel AI/ML approaches adaptable to molecular property prediction
**Tier 3 (Contextual Relevance)**: Papers providing foundational knowledge applicable across domains

The analyzed paper falls into **Tier 3**, explaining its low direct utility despite methodological soundness.

## 2. Strategic Research Intelligence Synthesis

### Knowledge Gap Mapping
The analysis exposes **three critical knowledge gaps**:

1. **Molecular Representation Gap**: General neural networks lack chemical structure encoding capabilities essential for ADMET prediction
2. **Domain Knowledge Integration Gap**: Biomedical applications don't address pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles
3. **Validation Methodology Gap**: General ML validation doesn't account for chemical space coverage and molecular diversity requirements

### Competitive Intelligence Implications
This false positive suggests that **competitors may face similar literature curation challenges**, creating opportunities for:
- More sophisticated search strategies
- Domain-specific literature databases
- AI-assisted relevance filtering systems

## 3. Advanced Methodological Insights

### Neural Architecture Evolution for ADMET
While the paper discusses general architectures, ADMET prediction requires **specialized adaptations**:

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Must incorporate chemical bond types, stereochemistry, and molecular conformations
**Transformers**: Need molecular tokenization strategies (SMILES, SELFIES, molecular fragments)
**CNNs**: Require molecular fingerprint representations or 3D molecular structure encoding

### Transfer Learning Opportunities
The general neural network knowledge could be **strategically leveraged** through:
- Pre-training on large biomedical datasets, then fine-tuning on ADMET data
- Multi-task learning combining general biomedical prediction with ADMET endpoints
- Domain adaptation techniques bridging general biomedicine to molecular prediction

## 4. Predictive Research Trajectory Analysis

### Emerging Research Directions
Based on this analysis, I predict **three high-impact research trajectories**:

1. **Hybrid Architecture Development**: Combining domain-agnostic neural networks with chemistry-aware components

- Develop competitive positioning strategy

### Long-term Research Investment Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Papers combining novel AI architectures with molecular-specific applications
2. **Medium Priority**: Methodological advances in related domains (materials science, computational chemistry)
3. **Low Priority**: General AI/ML papers without clear domain adaptation pathways

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Literature Curation Risks
**Risk 1**: Missing high-impact papers due to overly restrictive filtering
**Mitigation**: Implement multi-stage filtering with expert review checkpoints

**Risk 2**: Including too many marginally relevant papers

Tool #1: think
I'll analyze this thought about literature relevance assessment for ADMET prediction research and extract structured insights.
Tool #2: current_time
## Deep Analysis of Literature Relevance Assessment

### Core Analysis Framework

Your thought demonstrates a systematic approach to literature relevance assessment with clear evaluation criteria:

**1. Structured Evaluation Methodology**
- **Thematic Alignment**: Correctly identifies ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) as the core research focus
- **Content Mapping**: Systematically maps article content against research objectives
- **Multi-dimensional Assessment**: Considers topic match, methodological relevance, conclusion value, innovation, and temporal relevance

### Key Insights from Your Analysis

**1. Relevance Classification Logic**
- **Primary vs. Secondary Focus**: You correctly distinguish that while the article mentions ADMET-related content, it's not the primary focus
- **Scope Assessment**: Recognizes this as a broad review covering the entire drug discovery pipeline, not specifically ADMET prediction
- **Proportional Relevance**: Understands that ADMET content represents a small portion of the overall article

**2. Methodological Rigor**
- **Specific Evidence Identification**: You identify concrete ADMET-related mentions (DeepTox, toxicity prediction, pharmacokinetics properties)
- **Contextual Understanding**: Recognizes the difference between review articles and primary research papers
- **Scoring Rationale**: Provides clear justification for the 0.4-0.6 relevance score range

### Critical Implications and Connections

**1. Literature Review Strategy Implications**
- **Inclusion Criteria Refinement**: This analysis suggests need for more specific ADMET-focused inclusion criteria
- **Review Type Consideration**: Different weighting for primary research vs. review articles in ADMET prediction

- **Methodological Depth**: Suggests need for papers with deeper ADMET-specific methodological contributions

### Actionable Conclusions

**1. Immediate Assessment Actions**
- **Relevance Score**: Assign 0.5/1.0 (moderate relevance) based on your analysis
- **Classification**: Tag as "Peripheral Relevance - AI Drug Discovery Review with ADMET Components"
- **Extraction Priority**: Lower priority for detailed metadata extraction given limited ADMET focus

**2. Systematic Review Protocol Refinements**
```
Relevance Scoring Framework:
- 0.8-1.0: Primary ADMET prediction focus
- 0.6-0.7: Significant ADMET methodology/results
- 0.4-0.5: Mentions ADMET within broader context
- 0.2-0.3: Tangential ADMET relevance
- 0.0-0.1: No meaningful ADMET connection
```

**3. Metadata Extraction Strategy**
- **Selective Extraction**: Focus on ADMET-specific sections rather than full article
- **Cross-referencing**: Use this article to identify more specific ADMET prediction papers in its references
- **Categorization**: Include in "Background/Context" rather than "Core Evidence" category

### Strategic Recommendations

**1. Search Strategy Optimization**
- Refine search terms to target ADMET-specific AI applications

# Deep Analytical Processing: Literature Relevance Assessment Framework Evolution

## Meta-Analysis of the Assessment Process

### Cognitive Architecture of Relevance Evaluation

The previous cycle reveals a sophisticated **multi-layered evaluation system** that operates on several cognitive levels:

**1. Pattern Recognition Layer**
- Identifies semantic markers (ADMET terminology, methodology keywords)
- Maps content distribution across article sections
- Recognizes hierarchical information structures (primary vs. secondary focus)

**2. Contextual Integration Layer**
- Synthesizes article positioning within broader research landscape
- Evaluates methodological contributions relative to field standards
- Assesses temporal and technological relevance

**3. Strategic Decision Layer**
- Translates assessment into actionable classification decisions
- Balances inclusion/exclusion trade-offs
- Optimizes resource allocation for detailed analysis

## Advanced Implications and Emergent Insights

### 1. **Epistemological Considerations**

The assessment framework reveals deeper questions about **knowledge boundaries** in interdisciplinary research:

- **Boundary Spanning**: How do we evaluate papers that bridge multiple domains (AI/ML + pharmacology + toxicology)?
- **Knowledge Transfer**: What constitutes sufficient methodological transfer from general AI to ADMET-specific applications?
- **Innovation Recognition**: How do we identify novel approaches that may not fit traditional ADMET prediction paradigms?

### 2. **Methodological Evolution Patterns**

The analysis suggests **three evolutionary stages** in ADMET prediction literature:

```
Stage 1: Traditional QSAR → Limited AI integration
Stage 2: AI/ML adoption → Broad application reviews  
Stage 3: Specialized ADMET-AI → Deep methodological innovation
```

**Strategic Implication**: Current assessment may need **temporal weighting** - newer papers in Stage 3 may warrant higher relevance scores even with less comprehensive coverage.

### 3. **Information Architecture Optimization**

The framework suggests a **hierarchical information extraction strategy**:

**Tier 1 (Core Evidence)**: Primary ADMET prediction studies
- Full metadata extraction
- Detailed methodology analysis
- Validation dataset documentation

**Tier 2 (Supporting Evidence)**: Significant ADMET components in broader studies
- Selective section extraction
- Cross-reference mining
- Methodological component isolation

**Tier 3 (Contextual Background)**: Peripheral mentions in comprehensive reviews
- Citation network analysis
- Trend identification
- Gap recognition

## Novel Connections and Synthesis

### 1. **Dynamic Relevance Scoring**

Traditional static scoring (0.0-1.0) may be insufficient. Consider **multidimensional relevance vectors**:

```
Relevance Vector = [
    Topical_Alignment: 0.5,
    Methodological_Innovation: 0.7,
    Validation_Rigor: 0.3,
    Temporal_Currency: 0.9,
    Citation_Potential: 0.6
]
```

This enables **context-sensitive weighting** based on review objectives.

### 2. **Predictive Assessment Framework**

The analysis suggests potential for **predictive relevance modeling**:
- Abstract-based preliminary scoring
- Full-text confirmation protocols
- Machine learning-assisted classification refinement

### 3. **Network Effect Considerations**

Individual paper relevance may be **amplified or diminished** by:
- Citation network position
- Author expertise overlap
- Methodological complementarity with other included papers

## Actionable Strategic Framework

### 1. **Adaptive Assessment Protocol**

```
IF (paper_type == "comprehensive_review") THEN
    focus_on = "reference_mining + gap_identification"
    extraction_depth = "selective"
    
ELIF (paper_type == "primary_research") THEN
    focus_on = "methodology + validation + results"
    extraction_depth = "comprehensive"
    
ELIF (paper_type == "methodological_innovation") THEN
    focus_on = "novel_approaches + transferability"
    extraction_depth = "deep_technical"
```

### 2. **Quality Assurance Integration**

Implement **cross-validation mechanisms**:
- Multiple assessor agreement on borderline cases (0.4-0.6 range)
- Systematic bias detection in scoring patterns
- Calibration studies with known relevance benchmarks

### 3. **Continuous Framework Evolution**

The assessment framework should **adapt based on emerging patterns**:
- Regular recalibration of scoring thresholds
- Integration of new ADMET prediction paradigms
- Feedback loops from downstream analysis quality

## Future-Oriented Considerations

### 1. **Emerging Technology Integration**

As AI/ML in ADMET prediction evolves, the framework must accommodate:
- **Multimodal approaches** (combining molecular, clinical, and real-world data)
- **Federated learning** applications in pharmaceutical research
- **Explainable AI** requirements for regulatory acceptance

### 2. **Interdisciplinary Boundary Evolution**

The framework should anticipate **expanding relevance boundaries**:
- Integration with systems biology approaches
- Personalized medicine applications
- Regulatory science developments

## Synthesis and Meta-Insights

This deep analysis reveals that **literature relevance assessment is itself a complex knowledge synthesis process** that mirrors the interdisciplinary nature of modern ADMET prediction research. The framework's strength lies not just in its systematic approach, but in its **adaptive capacity** to evolve with the field.

The key insight is that **relevance is not binary but contextual** - the same paper may have different relevance scores depending on the specific research questions, methodological focus, and temporal context of the systematic review.

**Ultimate Recommendation**: Develop a **living assessment framework** that combines systematic rigor with adaptive flexibility, enabling both consistent evaluation and evolution with the rapidly advancing field of AI-driven ADMET prediction.

## Meta-Cognitive Analysis of the Assessment Evolution

### Emergent Complexity Recognition

The previous cycle reveals a **paradigm shift** from simple relevance scoring to **dynamic knowledge ecosystem mapping**. This evolution suggests we're not merely assessing literature relevance, but constructing a **living knowledge architecture** that adapts to the rapidly evolving AI-ADMET intersection.

## Advanced Theoretical Framework Development

### 1. **Quantum Relevance Theory**

Building on the multidimensional relevance vectors, I propose a **Quantum Relevance Model** where papers exist in **superposition states** of relevance until observed within specific research contexts:

```
Ψ(relevance) = α|highly_relevant⟩ + β|moderately_relevant⟩ + γ|peripherally_relevant⟩
```

**Key Insight**: The act of assessment **collapses** this superposition based on the observer's (reviewer's) research objectives, temporal context, and methodological focus.

**Practical Implication**: Same paper can simultaneously hold multiple relevance states, resolved only when specific research questions are applied.

### 2. **Temporal Relevance Dynamics**

The framework suggests **relevance decay and amplification functions**:

```
R(t) = R₀ × e^(-λt) × (1 + Σ citation_boosts) × innovation_multiplier
```

Where:
- **λ** = field evolution rate (higher in AI/ML domains)
- **citation_boosts** = network effect amplifications
- **innovation_multiplier** = paradigm-shifting potential factor

### 3. **Methodological Resonance Theory**

Papers exhibit **methodological resonance** - their relevance amplifies when combined with complementary approaches:

**Resonance Patterns Identified**:
- **Harmonic**: Traditional QSAR + Modern ML (constructive interference)
- **Dissonant**: Conflicting validation methodologies (destructive interference)
- **Emergent**: Novel combinations creating new research directions

  "title": "ADMETlab 2.0: an integrated online platform for accurate and comprehensive predictions of ADMET properties",
  "abstract": "Because undesirable pharmacokinetics and toxicity of candidate compounds are the main reasons for the failure of drug development, it has been widely recognized that absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) should be evaluated as early as possible. In silico ADMET evaluation models have been developed as an additional tool to assist medicinal chemists in the design and optimization of leads. Here, we announced the release of ADMETlab 2.0, a completely redesigned version of the widely used AMDETlab web server for the predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties of chemicals, of which the supported ADMET-related endpoints are approximately twice the number of the endpoints in the previous version, including 17 physicochemical properties, 13 medicinal chemistry properties, 23 ADME properties, 27 toxicity endpoints and 8 toxicophore rules (751 substructures). A multi-task graph attention framework was employed to develop the robust and accurate models in ADMETlab 2.0. The batch computation module was provided in response to numerous requests from users, and the representation of the results was further optimized. The ADMETlab 2.0 server is freely available, without registration, at https://admetmesh.scbdd.com/.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET prediction", "graph neural networks", "multi-task learning", "drug discovery", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity prediction", "web server"],
  "methods": "ADMETlab 2.0 was built using the Python web framework of Django and deployed on an elastic compute service from Aliyun running an Ubuntu Linux system. A multi-task graph attention (MGA) framework was employed to develop the robust and accurate models. MGA is composed of the input, relation graph convolution network (RGCN) layers, attention layer, and fully-connected (FC) layers. In the input, a node represents the information of an atom, and after passing the RGCN layers, the node represents the general features of the circular substructure centered on the atom. The attention layers can assign different attention weights to different substructures, and then generate the customized fingerprints from the general features for a specific task. For each endpoint, the dataset was split into the training, validation and test sets by a ratio of 8:1:1, and stratified sampling was used when partitioning the data for classification to keep the ratio of the positive and negative instances in the three subsets balanced. The model training process was repeated ten times with random data splitting to obtain robust and accurate prediction models.",
  "results": "A total of 53 prediction models were implemented, including 40 classification models and 13 regression models. For the classification models, most of them achieved an AUC of 0.85 or higher, with 27 models reaching the ACC values above 0.8. The average MCC value of these models is 0.53 and 50% of models obtain a MCC of more than 0.5. For the regression models, most of them achieved an R2 above 0.72. The MGA models could yield better performance relative to the corresponding XGBoost models, except for seven classification and two regression endpoints. A typical ADMETlab 2.0 task for 1000 molecules requires about 84 seconds, while the time required to run 20 molecules in the initial version is about 1574 s. The leave-cluster-out validation showed that classification endpoints could obtain an average MCC of 0.47, and regression endpoints could obtain an average R2 of 0.65.",
  "conclusions": "ADMETlab 2.0 significantly enhanced the functionality of its predecessor. The new webserver provides the users easy access to comprehensive, accurate and efficient prediction of the ADMET profiles for chemicals, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties, as well as some important physicochemical and medicinal chemistry properties. The available ADMET profile is extended to 88 related characteristics, roughly twice the number of its predecessor. The advanced MGA framework was employed to construct robust and accurate models as the foundation of the platform. We believe that ADMETlab 2.0 will prove useful in accelerating the process of drug R&D.",

  "abstract": "New computational methods, based on statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques using drug-related entities (e.g., genes, protein bindings, etc.), help reduce the costs of in-vitro experiments through drug-drug interaction prediction (DDIp). This review examines recent advances in DDIp. It presents an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art studies relating to semi-supervised, supervised, self-supervised learning, and other techniques such as graph-based learning and matrix factorization methods for predicting DDIs. All possible interactions between drugs are not known, and accurately predicting interactions is even more difficult due to the complex nature of drug-drug interactions (DDI).",

The authors conducted a comprehensive search in the WoS database using the queries: 'supervised learning drug-drug interaction', 'semi-supervised learning drug-drug interaction', 'self-supervised learning drug-drug interaction', 'structured learning drug-drug interaction' across all fields. The search yielded a total of 49 unique papers published starting in 2011. We assessed titles and abstracts to ensure paper relevance. Only articles that specifically dealt with predicting DDIs with a type of ML algorithm were considered relevant. We identified 24 papers highly relevant to ML methods for DDI prediction.",
  "results": "The main limitations are class imbalance, poor performance on new drugs, limited explainability, and the need for additional data sources. Semi-supervised learning techniques enhance model performance using both labeled and unlabeled data. Supervised learning methods range from classic regression models to sophisticated neural networks. Self-supervised learning methods generate labels from the data itself, often using pretext tasks to learn useful representations. Graph-based learning methods model the interactions between drugs as a graph, using GNNs or other graph-based techniques to predict DDIs. Matrix factorization methods decompose interaction matrices into lower-dimensional representations to predict unknown drug interactions.",
  "conclusions": "Recently, ML techniques have been shown to be very promising for predicting DDIs. The analyzed papers significantly contributed to DDI prediction by integrating various data sources into predictive models, developing semi-supervised learning frameworks, advancing graph-based learning methods, and introducing self-supervised learning and contrastive learning approaches.

## Deep Analytical Processing of Literature Relevance Assessment

### **Core Analysis Framework**

Your thought demonstrates a systematic approach to evaluating literature relevance, which I'll analyze across multiple dimensions:

### **1. Relevance Assessment Accuracy**

**Strengths in Your Analysis:**
- **Clear Domain Distinction**: You correctly identified that drug resistance prediction (pharmacodynamics) differs fundamentally from ADMET prediction (pharmacokinetics/toxicology)
- **Methodological Recognition**: Acknowledged that while both use deep learning/GNN approaches, the application domains are distinct
- **Structured Evaluation**: Applied multiple criteria (topic matching, methodological relevance, conclusion value, innovation)

**Critical Insight**: Your assessment correctly identifies this as a **low-relevance** paper for ADMET research, which is crucial for maintaining research focus and avoiding scope creep.

### **2. Methodological Implications**

**Connection Points You Identified:**
- Both fields utilize graph neural networks for molecular representation
- Deep learning architectures are common to both domains
- Predictive modeling approaches share computational foundations

**Deeper Implications:**
- **Transfer Learning Potential**: While the direct application differs, GNN architectures developed for drug resistance might inform ADMET model design
- **Feature Engineering**: Block-based dual adaptive approaches could potentially be adapted for ADMET property prediction
- **Data Integration**: Methods for handling complex biological relationships (ncRNA-drug interactions) might inform multi-target ADMET modeling

### **3. Strategic Research Considerations**

**Information Extraction Approach:**
Your systematic plan to extract:
- Title, Abstract, Keywords
- Methods, Results, Conclusions

This structured approach ensures comprehensive evaluation while maintaining efficiency.

**Quality Control Insight**: The absence of explicit keywords in the literature highlights the importance of content-based relevance assessment rather than relying solely on metadata.

### **4. Actionable Conclusions**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Classification**: Mark this literature as "Low Relevance" for ADMET research
2. **Methodological Note**: Document the GNN approach for potential future reference in ADMET model architecture design
3. **Database Management**: Categorize under "Drug Resistance/Pharmacodynamics" rather than "ADMET/Pharmacokinetics"

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Search Refinement**: This analysis suggests your literature search criteria may need refinement to better filter for ADMET-specific content
- **Keyword Optimization**: Consider adding negative keywords related to drug resistance to improve search precision
- **Review Efficiency**: Develop rapid screening criteria to identify off-topic papers earlier in the review process

### **5. Meta-Analytical Insights**

**Process Optimization:**
Your analytical framework demonstrates strong systematic thinking. Consider developing a standardized relevance scoring rubric:
- Topic Alignment (0-3 points)
- Methodological Relevance (0-2 points)  
- Practical Application (0-2 points)
- Innovation Transfer Potential (0-1 point)

**Quality Assurance:**
The depth of your analysis ensures high-quality literature curation, which is essential for meaningful ADMET prediction research synthesis.

### **Final Recommendation**

**Disposition**: Exclude from primary ADMET literature review but retain in supplementary database with "Methodological Interest" tag for potential future reference in GNN architecture development.

**Process Enhancement**: Your analytical approach is sound and thorough. Consider developing templates```json

  "title": "Empowering Graph Neural Networks with Block-Based Dual Adaptive Deep Adjustment for Drug Resistance-Related NcRNA Discovery",
  "abstract": "Drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents remains a formidable challenge in cancer treatment, significantly impacting treatment efficacy. Extensive research has exposed the intimate involvement of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in conferring resistance to cancer drugs. Understanding the intricate associations between ncRNAs and drug resistance is of pivotal importance in advancing clinical interventions and expediting drug development. However, traditional biological experimental methods are hampered by limitations, such as labor intensiveness, time consumption, and constraints in scalability. Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of efficient computational methods for the accurate prediction of potential ncRNA-drug resistance associations (NDRA). However, most existing predictive models primarily focus on known ncRNA-drug resistance associations, often neglecting the critical aspect of similarity information between ncRNAs and drug resistance. This oversight may hinder the accuracy of characterizing these associations. To overcome the limitations of existing computational models, we proposed B-NDRA, a computational framework designed for the discovery of drug resistance-related ncRNA. Initially, we constructed a heterogeneous graph that integrates ncRNA-drug resistance pairs, leveraging both known associations and similarity fusion information between ncRNAs and drug resistance. Subsequently, we employed an attention mechanism to aggregate local features of graph nodes following a dimensionality reduction of node features. Further, a graph neural network (GNN) facilitated the learning of global node embeddings. Notably, the integration of dual adaptive deep adjustment architectures, encompassing intrablock and interblock methodologies, enabled efficient extraction of global features while balancing local and global features. Finally, B-NDRA employed a multilayer perceptron to predict associations between ncRNAs and drug resistance. Through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, B-NDRA achieved average AUC, AUPR, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score values of 92.2%, 91.9%, 84.88%, 86.9%, 82.37%, and 84.44%, respectively.",
  "keywords": [],
  "methods": "The study employed a computational framework B-NDRA for discovering drug resistance-related ncRNA associations. Data sets were constructed from NcDR and NoncoRNA databases, resulting in 2682 known ncRNA-drug resistance association pairs involving 622 ncRNA nodes and 116 drug nodes. Drug semantic similarity was calculated using MeSH database descriptors and directed acyclic graphs (DAG). NcRNA functional similarity was computed based on drug semantic similarity. Similarity kernel fusion was applied using Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity to enhance ncRNA and drug similarity information. A heterogeneous graph was constructed integrating known associations with fused similarity matrices. The model employed dimension projection to map heterogeneous features into the same space, followed by attention mechanisms for local feature extraction. Global features were extracted using graph neural networks with block-based dual adaptive deep adjustment architectures encompassing intrablock and interblock mechanisms. Finally, a multilayer perceptron was used for association prediction with cross-entropy loss function optimization.",
  "results": "B-NDRA achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models across three 5-fold cross-validation strategies.

In CVn experiments, AUC reached 92.02%, AUPR 91.65%, Accuracy 82.90%, Precision 90.21%, Recall 73.99%, and F1-score 81.12%. In CVnd experiments, AUC was 92.20%, AUPR 91.90%, Accuracy 84.88%, Precision 86.90%, Recall 82.37%, and F1-score 84.44%. Comparative analysis showed improvements over GRPMDA, GAEMDA, and LRGCPND models across most metrics. Optimal performance was achieved with projection dimension of 32, block parameter b=2, and layer parameter k=10. Case studies on Doxorubicin and Imatinib validated 16 out of top 20 predicted ncRNA associations through literature confirmation, demonstrating practical applicability for discovering potential drug resistance-related ncRNA associations.",
  "conclusions": "B-NDRA demonstrated superior performance in identifying ncRNA-drug resistance associations through block-based dual adaptive deep adjustment on graph neural networks. The model effectively integrated similarity information and achieved optimal balance between local and global features through intrablock and interblock adaptive adjustments. Experimental results confirmed B-NDRA's robustness across different validation strategies and its practical utility in discovering novel associations. The integration of comprehensive similarity information enhanced prediction efficiency and accelerated discovery of ncRNA-targeting therapeutics. However, current data limitations necessitate future integration of additional biological information including ncRNA sequences, expression profiles, and drug substructure fingerprints to further enrich understanding of drug resistance mechanisms.",

  "title": "Hybrid fragment-SMILES tokenization for ADMET prediction in drug discovery",
  "abstract": "Background: Drug discovery and development is the extremely costly and time-consuming process of identifying new molecules that can interact with a biomarker target to interrupt the disease pathway of interest. In addition to binding the target, a drug candidate needs to satisfy multiple properties affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). Artificial intelligence approaches provide an opportunity to improve each step of the drug discovery and development process, in which the first question faced by us is how a molecule can be informatively represented such that the in-silico solutions are optimized. Results: This study introduces a novel hybrid SMILES-fragment tokenization method, coupled with two pre-training strategies, utilizing a Transformer-based model. We investigate the efficacy of hybrid tokenization in improving the performance of ADMET prediction tasks. Our approach leverages MTL-BERT, an encoder-only Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art ADMET predictions, and contrasts the standard SMILES tokenization with our hybrid method across a spectrum of fragment library cutoffs. Conclusion: The findings reveal that while an excess of fragments can impede performance, using hybrid tokenization with high frequency fragments enhances results beyond the base SMILES tokenization. This advancement underscores the potential of integrating fragment- and character-level molecular features within the training of Transformer models for ADMET property prediction.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET prediction", "Transformer", "Fragments", "SMILES", "Drug discovery"],
  "methods": "We adopt the MTL-BERT model originally proposed by Zhang et al. for predicting ADMET properties from SMILES strings. The model uses a multi-task learning framework based on BERT, a Transformer-based model that learns bidirectional representations from large-scale unlabelled data. We propose a novel tokenization procedure, named hybrid fragment-SMILES tokenization (HFST), that incorporates both fragments and SMILES, where SMILES fragments are generated using the method described in HierVAE and DeepFMPO. To encode a molecule using the hybrid method, we first fragment and loop through all fragments. If a fragment is in the vocabulary, we use a single numerical value for encoding. Otherwise, we encode the fragment using the SMILES atomic-level representation. We experiment with two different pre-training strategies: one-phase and two-phase. In one-phase pre-training, the Transformer model is pre-trained using the hybrid fragment-SMILES encoding. In two-phase pre-training, the Transformer model is pre-trained first on the SMILES encoding until no further performance improvement, and then afterwards on hybrid fragment-SMILES encoding until completion.",
  "results": "The results show that SMILES tokenization consistently achieved the best performance in two-phase approach, followed closely by the 1000 frequency hybrid tokenization, with worse metric values as more infrequent fragments are incorporated. When using one-phase pre-training, both SMILES and 1000 frequency hybrid tokenizations emerge as top performers. The one-phase 1000 frequency hybrid tokenization consistently outperforms SMILES across most tasks, with an exception in the blood-brain barrier predictive task. On the TDC ADMET group benchmark encompassing 22 datasets, the one-phase 1000 frequency HFST demonstrates superior performance over the traditional SMILES notation for molecular language modelling in a majority of the benchmark tasks. The HFST excels in predicting bioavailability and hepatocyte clearance, while SMILES tokenization shows its strengths in CYP 2C9 substrate and microsome clearance tasks. Overall, models demonstrated better performance on classification tasks than on regression tasks.",
  "conclusions": "The findings underscore the critical role of data representation and learning methodology in achieving accurate predictions for classification and regression tasks. Although SMILES tokenization remains a robust baseline, our hybrid approach, especially at the 1000 frequency level, consistently outperforms SMILES tokenization. However, the selection of a frequency cutoff significantly impacts model performance, and incorporating lower frequency fragments tends to have a detrimental affect on ADMET predictions. The hybrid encoding idea is applicable to other line notation representation methods for molecules, such as SELFIES, along with suitable fragmentation techniques, and to a range of quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) predictive tasks.",

  "abstract": "The acid dissociation constant (pKa) is a critical parameter to reflect the ionization ability of chemical compounds and is widely applied in a variety of industries. However, the experimental determination of pKa is intricate and time-consuming, especially for the exact determination of micro-pKa information at the atomic level. Hence, a fast and accurate prediction of pKa values of chemical compounds is of broad interest. Here, we compiled a large-scale pKa dataset containing 16 595 compounds with 17 489 pKa values.

  "results": "Graph-pKa achieved superior performance with MAE around 0.55 and R² around 0.92 on test datasets, outperforming conventional machine learning models (SVM, RF, XGBoost, ANN) across all similarity subsets. On external SAMPL6 and SAMPL7 datasets, Graph-pKa achieved MAE of 0.594 and 0.758 with R² of 0.918 and 0.839 respectively, comparable to commercial software. For micro-pKa prediction, consistency rates with human experts exceeded 90%, with 80% of controversial molecules showing difference values within 1.2 pKa units. The model successfully identified dominant ionization sites, with atomic embeddings showing clustering patterns for different functional groups (phenol hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonamide groups clustered together while alcoholic hydroxyl and amide groups remained dispersed).",
  "conclusions": "Graph-pKa represents a significant advancement in pKa prediction by combining multi-instance learning with graph neural networks. The model not only outperforms conventional approaches in macro-pKa prediction but uniquely provides micro-pKa inference capability, learning chemical insights to locate most acidic/basic sites comparable to human experts. This dual-level prediction capability greatly enhances interpretability and practicability. The fitting and prediction of macro-pKa depends on micro-pKa reasoning, avoiding shortcut learning.

# Advanced Analytical Processing - Cycle 2/3: Strategic Literature Integration Framework

## 1. Deep Synthesis of Previous Analysis

### Methodological Evolution Trajectory
The ADMETlab analysis reveals a **critical inflection point** in computational drug discovery methodology. The 2018 timeframe represents the transition period where traditional machine learning approaches (RF, SVM, NB, DT) were reaching maturity while deep learning was emerging as the dominant paradigm. This temporal positioning makes ADMETlab a **methodological bridge** rather than just a baseline.

### Strategic Value Proposition
**Beyond Simple Relevance**: ADMETlab's true value lies not in its algorithmic sophistication, but in its **systematic approach to ADMET endpoint coverage**. The 31 endpoints represent a comprehensive mapping of the ADMET landscape that modern deep learning approaches must match or exceed.

  "title": "ADMETlab: a platform for systematic ADMET evaluation based on a comprehensively collected ADMET database",
  "abstract": "Current pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) is a high-risk investment which is usually faced with some unexpected even disastrous failures in different stages of drug discovery. One main reason for R&D failures is the efficacy and safety deficiencies which are related largely to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties and various toxicities (T). Therefore, rapid ADMET evaluation is urgently needed to minimize failures in the drug discovery process. Here, we developed a web-based platform called ADMETlab for systematic ADMET evaluation of chemicals based on a comprehensively collected ADMET database consisting of 288,967 entries. Four function modules in the platform enable users to conveniently perform six types of drug-likeness analysis (five rules and one prediction model), 31 ADMET endpoints prediction (basic property: 3, absorption: 6, distribution: 3, metabolism: 10, elimination: 2, toxicity: 7), systematic evaluation and database/similarity searching. We believe that this web platform will hopefully facilitate the drug discovery process by enabling early drug-likeness evaluation, rapid ADMET virtual screening or filtering and prioritization of chemical structures.",
  "keywords": ["ADMETlab", "ADMET", "Drug-likeness", "ADMET database", "Drug discovery", "Cheminformatics"],
  "methods": "The ADMETlab platform was developed using Python as the main programming language with Django framework for web development. Data collection involved two parts: manually filtered peer-reviewed publications and data from ChEMBL, EPA and DrugBank databases, resulting in 288,967 entries. For modeling, six different algorithms were applied: random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), recursive partitioning regression (RP), partial least square (PLS), naïve Bayes (NB) and decision tree (DT). Molecular descriptors included 11 types (403 descriptors total) and fingerprints (FP2, MACCS, ECFP2, ECFP4, ECFP6). Descriptor selection used internal importance ranking function in random forest. For unbalanced datasets, resampling strategies and ensemble techniques were applied. Model performance was evaluated using fivefold cross-validation and external test sets.",
  "results": "The platform provides 31 ADMET prediction models with improved performance: 9 regression models and 22 classification models. Most models achieved good performance with LogS, LogD7.4 and Caco-2 obtaining Q2 > 0.84; 86% of classification models achieved accuracy > 0.7; 50% achieved accuracy > 0.8. RF method showed best ability for regression models while SVM and RF with ECFP4 performed best for classification. The drug-likeness classification model achieved accuracy of 0.800 and AUC of 0.867. For unbalanced datasets like F20, SE/SP was optimized from 0.907/0.450 to 0.731/0.647 using proposed strategies. The platform includes four main modules: drug-likeness evaluation, ADMET prediction, systematic evaluation, and database searching with 288,967 entries.",
  "conclusions": "ADMETlab provides a user-friendly, freely available web platform for systematic ADMET evaluation based on a comprehensive database of 288,967 entries. The platform offers well-performed prediction models using different representation patterns and modeling methods, enabling overall ADMET assessment, virtual screening, and structure optimization hints. Future improvements will include more practical models for new ADMET properties, optimization of hard-to-predict models, regular database updates, and integrated ADMET space analysis. This platform facilitates drug discovery through early evaluation, rapid ADMET screening, and chemical structure prioritization.",

  "abstract": "Amid the pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected by SARS-CoV-2, a vast amount of drug research for prevention and treatment has been quickly conducted, but these efforts have been unsuccessful thus far. Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a drug repurposing pipeline that systematically integrates multiple SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural networks, and in-vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all the available drugs (n= 3,635) involved in COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a SARS-CoV-2 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate drug's representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and electronic health records. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep neural networks, and rigorous validation can facilitate the rapid identification of candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.",
  "keywords": [],
  "methods": "We collected SARS-CoV-2 and host interaction data from 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with 332 high confidence PPIs. Drug-target interactions were obtained from CTDbase's COVID-19 curated list containing 3,635 compounds targeting 4,427 genes. We utilized deep graph neural embedding with multi-relational variational graph autoencoders and GraphSAGE message passing. The embedding size was set to 128. We transferred universal representation from DRKG to enhance our embedding. For drug ranking, we designed a neural-network-based ranking model with Bayesian pairwise ranking loss using clinical trial drugs as labels. The architecture included two fully connected layers (128→128→1) with residual connection, ReLU activation, dropout, and batch normalization.",
  "results": "We built a SARS-CoV-2 Knowledge Graph with 27 virus baits, 5,677 host genes, 3,635 drugs, and 1,285 phenotypes connected by five types of edges. The graph embedding achieved AUROC 0.8121 and AUPRC 0.8524 in link prediction. The drug ranking model showed AUROC between 0.77-0.90. From genetic validation using GSEA, we identified 183 statistically significant drugs including Azithromycin (ES=−0.479), Atorvastatin (ES=−0.550), and Nifedipine (ES=−0.435). In-vitro validation showed recall between 0.21-0.44 and precision between 0.04-0.18. Population-based EHR validation identified 10 effective drugs with positive treatment effects, including Azithromycin (ATT=13.08), Ceftriaxone (ATT=13.05), and Acetaminophen (ATT=10.27).",

  "title": "ADMET property prediction via multi-task graph learning under adaptive auxiliary task selection",
  "abstract": "It is a critical step in lead optimization to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug-like compounds. Classical single-task learning (STL) has effectively predicted individual ADMET endpoints with abundant labels. Conversely, multi-task learning (MTL) can predict multiple ADMET endpoints with fewer labels, but ensuring task synergy and highlighting key molecular substructures remain challenges. To tackle these issues, this work elaborates a multi-task graph learning framework for predicting multiple ADMET properties of drug-like small molecules (MTGL-ADMET) by holding a new paradigm of MTL, \"one primary, multiple auxiliaries.\" It first adeptly combines status theory with maximum flow for auxiliary task selection. The subsequent phase introduces a primary-task-centric MTL model with integrated modules. MTGL-ADMET not only outstrips existing STL and MTL methods but also offers a transparent lens into crucial molecular substructures. It is anticipated that this work can promote lead compound finding and optimization in drug discovery.",
  "keywords": ["Drugs", "Machine learning", "Multidisciplinary Design Optimization"],
  "methods": "The MTGL-ADMET framework consists of two stages: adaptive auxiliary task selection and multi-task learning model. For auxiliary task selection, the method builds a task association network by measuring differences between individual and pairwise task performances, applies status theory for preliminary auxiliary selection, and uses maximum flow calculation for optimal auxiliary task selection. The multi-task learning model contains four components: (1) Task-shared atom embedding module using two-layer residual GCN to learn atom representations shared by all tasks, (2) Task-specific molecular embedding module leveraging parallel attention layers to generate task-specific molecular representations, (3) Primary task-centered gating module learning how auxiliary tasks contribute to the primary task through gating networks, and (4) Multi-task predictor with task-specific fully-connected neural networks. The dataset covers 24 ADMET endpoints from 8 publications with 43,291 drug-like compounds. Each compound is represented by 40-dimensional binary atom features and encoded into 64-dimensional embeddings through ResGCN.",
  "results": "MTGL-ADMET achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of 4.6% over ST-GCN, 2.4% over ST-MGA, 6.8% over MT-GCN, 4.1% over MT-GCNAtt, and 4.1% over MGA. The method won best performance on 20 out of 24 tasks and second best on the remaining 4 tasks. Ablation studies showed that the adaptive selection strategy outperformed other selection methods (Single, Rand-5, Top-5) by 3.16%, 3.60%, and 1.85% respectively. The maximum flux calculation showed significant Spearman correlation (γ=0.9562, ρ=2.6089e−08) with performance increments. Component analysis revealed that attention blocks and gate networks contributed 3.1% and 1.1% performance improvements respectively. The model successfully identified task-specific molecular substructures, with hydrophilic groups (hydroxyl, amino) for absorption tasks, lipophilic groups (phenyl rings) for BBB penetration, and aromatic rings for CYP enzyme inhibition.",

The \"one primary, multiple auxiliaries\" paradigm combined with status theory and maximum flow techniques enables adaptive auxiliary task selection. The framework demonstrates superior performance over existing STL and MTL methods while providing interpretable insights into crucial molecular substructures.

  "title": "Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Toxicity Prediction",
  "abstract": "Predictive modeling of toxicity is a crucial step in the drug discovery pipeline. It can help filter out molecules with a high probability of failing in the early stages of de novo drug design. Thus, several machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the toxicity of molecules by combining classical ML techniques or deep neural networks with well-known molecular representations such as fingerprints or 2D graphs. But the more natural, accurate representation of molecules is expected to be defined in physical 3D space like in ab initio methods. Recent studies successfully used equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) for representation learning based on 3D structures to predict quantum-mechanical properties of molecules. Inspired by this, we investigated the performance of EGNNs to construct reliable ML models for toxicity prediction. We used the equivariant transformer (ET) model in TorchMD-NET for this. Eleven toxicity data sets taken from MoleculeNet, TDCommons, and ToxBenchmark have been considered to evaluate the capability of ET for toxicity prediction. Our results show that ET adequately learns 3D representations of molecules that can successfully correlate with toxicity activity, achieving good accuracies on most data sets comparable to state-of-the-art models.",
  "keywords": ["equivariant graph neural networks", "toxicity prediction", "3D molecular representation", "machine learning", "drug discovery", "QSAR modeling", "equivariant transformer"],
  "methods": "We used the equivariant transformer (ET) model in TorchMD-NET for toxicity prediction. The ET is an SE(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network that operates on 3D point clouds given by atomic coordinates and atomic numbers. The model uses scalar and vector features as node embeddings, with a distance filter implemented by learnable radial basis functions with cosine cutoff encoding interatomic distances. We generated high-quality 3D conformers using CREST software with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method. For MoleculeNet datasets, we used 3D conformers from the GEOM dataset. We evaluated both single-conformer and multi-conformer training approaches, selecting the most likely conformers based on Boltzmann weights. The model architecture incorporates a modified multihead attention mechanism that combines edge and node data with interatomic distances directly integrated into feature vectors.",
  "results": "ET achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on most datasets. On MoleculeNet datasets, ET performed comparably to GEM on Tox21 (0.780±0.004 vs 0.781±0.001) and ToxCast (0.685±0.009 vs 0.692±0.004), and outperformed other methods on BACE (0.832±0.009). For TDCommons datasets, ET achieved ROC-AUC scores of 0.836±0.003 on Ames, 0.839±0.017 on hERG, and 0.878±0.013 on DILI. The model significantly outperformed SMILES-based transformers across all datasets. Geometry information was found crucial for LD50 and Tox21 predictions but less critical for Ames. Multi-conformer training did not consistently improve performance over single-conformer training.

  "conclusions": "Our findings demonstrate that equivariant graph neural networks can effectively learn 3D molecular representations for toxicity prediction, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art 2D graph-based models while providing better explainability through attention weight analysis. The study reveals that 3D geometry information is beneficial for toxicity prediction, particularly for stress response pathway-related tasks in Tox21.

  "title": "Research on the optimization model of anti-breast cancer candidate drugs based on machine learning",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women globally, with its incidence rate continuously increasing, posing a serious threat to women's health. Although current treatments, such as drugs targeting estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), have extended patient survival, issues such as drug resistance and severe side effects remain widespread. This study proposes a machine learning-based optimization model for anti-breast cancer candidate drugs, aimed at enhancing biological activity and optimizing ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) properties through multi-objective optimization. Initially, grey relational analysis and Spearman correlation analysis were performed on the molecular descriptors of 1,974 compounds, identifying 91 key descriptors. A Random Forest model combined with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values was then used to further select the top 20 descriptors with the greatest impact on biological activity. The constructed Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model, using algorithms such as LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieved an R2 value of 0.743 for biological activity prediction, demonstrating strong predictive performance. Additionally, a multi-model fusion strategy and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm were employed to optimize both biological activity and ADMET properties, thereby improving the prediction of Caco-2, CYP3A4, hERG, HOB, and MN properties. For example, the best model for predicting Caco-2 achieved an F1 score of 0.8905, while the model for predicting CYP3A4 reached an F1 score of 0.9733. This multi-objective optimization model provides a novel and efficient tool for drug development, offering significant improvements in both biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties, with practical implications for the optimization of future anti-breast cancer drugs.",
  "keywords": ["breast cancer", "machine Learning", "quantitative structure-activity relationship models(QSAR)", "particle swarm optimization(PSO)", "ADMET Properties", "drug screening", "biological Activity"],
  "methods": "The study employed a four-phase experimental design: Phase 1 involved data preprocessing where 225 features with all zero values were removed and data was normalized. Grey relational analysis was performed to select the 200 molecular descriptors most related to biological activity, followed by Spearman coefficient analysis, retaining 91 features. Random Forest combined with SHAP value analysis was used to select the top 20 molecular descriptors. Phase 2 used pIC50 as the target variable with 10 regression models to predict the selected features. LightGBM, RandomForest, and XGBoost were identified as best performers and combined using ensemble methods including simple averaging, weighted averaging, and stacking. Phase 3 used Random Forest for recursive feature elimination (RFE) on 504 features, selecting 25 important features for each of five ADMET properties (Caco-2, CYP3A4, hERG, HOB, and MN). Eleven machine learning classification models were constructed and evaluated using F1 score and ROC curve metrics. Phase 4 constructed a single-objective optimization model using 106 feature variables with high correlation to biological activity and ADMET properties, employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for multi-objective optimization search.",
  "results": "The stacking ensemble model achieved the best performance for biological activity prediction with an R2 value of 0.743. For ADMET property prediction, the best models achieved high F1 scores: LightGBM for Caco-2 (F1=0.8905), XGBoost for CYP3A4 (F1=0.9733), XGBoost for hERG (F1=0.9138), Naive Bayes for HOB (F1=0.6824), and XGBoost for MN (F1=0.9695). The multi-objective optimization using PSO algorithm successfully identified optimal value ranges for molecular descriptors that enhance both biological activity and ADMET properties. The optimized compounds met pre-defined ADMET property combinations while maintaining good biological activity. All 50 test compounds achieved ideal predictive results for both biological activity and ADMET properties, validating the model's effectiveness.",
  "conclusions": "This study successfully developed a machine learning-based optimization model for anti-breast cancer candidate drugs that significantly enhances both biological activity and ADMET properties. The integration of grey relational analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, and SHAP value screening effectively identified the most influential molecular descriptors. Multi-model fusion techniques improved biological activity prediction accuracy, while efficient classification models ensured superior pharmacokinetic performance prediction. The successful application of particle swarm optimization in multi-objective optimization demonstrates its potential in drug design. The model provides a novel and efficient solution for drug design and development, accelerating the development process of new anti-breast cancer drugs and offering theoretical foundations and technical support for future multi-objective drug optimization.",

  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is an advanced method to identify novel anticancer targets and discover novel drugs from biology networks because the networks can effectively preserve and quantify the interaction between components of cell systems underlying human diseases such as cancer. Here, we review and discuss how to employ artificial intelligence approaches to identify novel anticancer targets and discover drugs. First, we describe the scope of artificial intelligence biology analysis for novel anticancer target investigations. Second, we review and discuss the basic principles and theory of commonly used network-based and machine learning-based artificial intelligence algorithms. Finally, we showcase the applications of artificial intelligence approaches in cancer target identification and drug discovery. Taken together, the artificial intelligence models have provided us with a quantitative framework to study the relationship between network characteristics and cancer, thereby leading to the identification of potential anticancer targets and the discovery of novel drug candidates.",
  "keywords": ["Systems biology", "Tumour biomarkers", "Cancer"],
  "methods": "This study divides artificial intelligence biology analysis algorithms into two categories: network-based biology analysis algorithms (including shortest path, module detection, and network centrality) and machine learning-based biology analysis algorithms (including decision tree and deep learning models). Network-based algorithms focus on identifying therapeutic targets from molecular networks such as protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, and drug-drug interaction networks. Machine learning algorithms use network features including topological features (node centrality, interaction, local structure, subgraph, network propagation results) and biological information embedded in network nodes (gene expression profile, gene mutation frequency, gene functional annotation). Deep learning models, particularly graph-based neural networks, can take biological network structure as input directly and learn embeddings containing neighborhood information of target nodes.",

Network-based methods like WGCNA successfully identified 11 hub genes and 5 hub miRNAs with predictive power for colorectal cancer prognosis. Graph neural networks demonstrated superior performance in drug-target interaction prediction, with models like GraphDTA showing improved accuracy over traditional methods. For ADMET properties prediction, graph convolution networks like ChemiNet outperformed state-of-the-art circular fingerprint methods. The DTI-Voodoo model combining molecular features and phenotypes achieved high accuracy in drug-protein interaction prediction. GraphRepur showed significantly better performance than GCN, DNN, and random forest methods in drug repurposing for breast cancer.",

  "title": "Deep-PK: deep learning for small molecule pharmacokinetic and toxicity prediction",
  "abstract": "Evaluating pharmacokinetic properties of small molecules is considered a key feature in most drug development and high-throughput screening processes. Generally, pharmacokinetics, which represent the fate of drugs in the human body, are described from four perspectives: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion—all of which are closely related to a fifth perspective, toxicity (ADMET). Since obtaining ADMET data from in vitro, in vivo or pre-clinical stages is time consuming and expensive, many efforts have been made to predict ADMET properties via computational approaches. However, the majority of available methods are limited in their ability to provide pharmacokinetics and toxicity for diverse targets, ensure good overall accuracy, and offer ease of use, interpretability and extensibility for further optimizations. Here, we introduce Deep-PK, a deep learning-based pharmacokinetic and toxicity prediction, analysis and optimization platform. We applied graph neural networks and graph-based signatures as a graph-level feature to yield the best predictive performance across 73 endpoints, including 64 ADMET and 9 general properties. With these powerful models, Deep-PK supports molecular optimization and interpretation, aiding users in optimizing and understanding pharmacokinetics and toxicity for given input molecules.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET prediction", "deep learning", "graph neural networks", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity prediction", "drug discovery", "molecular optimization", "cheminformatics"],
  "methods": "Deep-PK relies on the D-MPNN (directed message passing neural network) framework from Chemprop. The core methodology involves: (1) Data collection and curation from four pharmacokinetic prediction databases (ADMETlab 2.0, Interpretable-ADMET, toxCSM, pkCSM) covering 73 endpoints including 64 ADMET and 9 general properties. (2) Molecular preprocessing including SMILES canonicalization, sanitization using RDKit, and removal of molecules with molecular weights ≥2000. (3) Feature engineering incorporating 216 graph-based signatures, 37 toxicophore counts, and 196 molecular descriptors from RDKit as graph-level features, in addition to 8 atom and 4 bond features from Chemprop. (4) Model training using Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) for classification and R² for regression tasks as loss functions, with 3-fold cross-validation ensemble method. (5) Hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian optimization with 500 randomly initialized runs and 500 posterior optimization values across 12 hyperparameters. (6) Implementation of MIMOSA method for molecular optimization generating up to 100 derivatives with improved QED scores.",
  "results": "Deep-PK demonstrated superior performance compared to existing tools across multiple benchmarks. Against ADMETlab 2.0 on 53 endpoints, Deep-PK showed enhanced performance on 46 endpoints with the highest improvement of 0.43 MCC on 'NR-A' endpoint, achieving significant improvement in 4 models, reasonable improvement in 17 models, and stability in 32 models. The most notable improvement was in metabolism category with average performance increase of +0.105 across 10 endpoints. Against toxCSM on 36 toxicity profiles, Deep-PK demonstrated enhanced performance on 30 endpoints, with substantial MCC improvement of 0.39 for 'NR-ER'. Overall performance averages were 0.58 for toxCSM and 0.71 for Deep-PK. On Deep-PK curated datasets, significant improvements were observed in 6 instances (up to +0.43 MCC increase on renal excretion OCT2), reasonable enhancements in 15 cases, and weaker improvements across 38 endpoints. The platform achieved consistent performance across all 73 endpoints with significant performance boost in excretion (+0.10 average MCC) and metabolism (+0.07 average MCC) categories.",
  "conclusions": "Deep-PK emerges as a robust screening and optimization platform for drug discovery, offering state-of-the-art GNN-based models that significantly reduce costs and time associated with experimental ADMET testing. The platform's integration of molecular properties as graph-level features substantially enhanced prediction performance, particularly achieving improvements >0.43 and 0.39 in MCC values for nuclear hormone receptors NR-AR and NR-ER respectively. Deep-PK addresses critical gaps in current ADMET tools by providing not only accurate predictions across 73 endpoints but also molecular optimization and interpretation capabilities. The platform's ability to generate 100 optimized molecules with improved drug-likeness scores, combined with interpretable substructure highlighting, makes it invaluable for targeted lead optimization efforts. While acknowledging limitations in data quality and the need for query molecules to inhabit similar chemical spaces to training data, Deep-PK represents a significant advancement toward comprehensive, AI-driven pharmaceutical research platforms.",

  "title": "Multi-type feature fusion based on graph neural network for drug-drug interaction prediction",
  "abstract": "Drug-Drug interactions (DDIs) are a challenging problem in drug research. Drug combination therapy is an effective solution to treat diseases, but it can also cause serious side effects. Therefore, DDIs prediction is critical in pharmacology. Recently, researchers have been using deep learning techniques to predict DDIs. However, these methods only consider single information of the drug and have shortcomings in robustness and scalability. In this paper, we propose a multi-type feature fusion based on graph neural network model (MFFGNN) for DDI prediction, which can effectively fuse the topological information in molecular graphs, the interaction information between drugs and the local chemical context in SMILES sequences. In MFFGNN, to fully learn the topological information of drugs, we propose a novel feature extraction module to capture the global features for the molecular graph and the local features for each atom of the molecular graph. In addition, in the multi-type feature fusion module, we use the gating mechanism in each graph convolution layer to solve the over-smoothing problem during information delivery. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real datasets. The results show that MFFGNN outperforms some state-of-the-art models for DDI prediction. Moreover, the cross-dataset experiment results further show that MFFGNN has good generalization performance.",
  "keywords": ["Multi-type feature fusion", "Graph neural network", "Gating mechanism", "Link prediction"],
  "methods": "The MFFGNN framework consists of four modules: (1) Molecular Graph Feature Extraction Module (MGFEM) uses graph interaction networks with graph wrap unit to extract topological structure features from molecular graphs, applying multi-head attention mechanism and gating coefficients to control information fusion; (2) SMILES Sequence Feature Extraction Module (SSFEM) employs Smi2Vec embedding and bi-directional gate recurrent unit (BiGRU) to extract local chemical context from SMILES sequences; (3) Multi-type Feature Fusion Module (MFFM) combines intra-drug features as initial node features in DDI network and uses GCN encoder with gating mechanism to fuse intra-drug and external DDI features; (4) DDI prediction through Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). The model uses graph contrastive learning to balance internal and external drug information, with learning objective L = Lr + αLc where Lr is reconstruction loss and Lc is contrastive loss.",
  "results": "MFFGNN achieved superior performance across three datasets: On ZhangDDI dataset (548 drugs, 48,548 DDI links), MFFGNN achieved AUROC 99.06±0.08, AUPRC 98.83±0.16, F1 97.97±0.25, outperforming MIRACLE (98.95±0.15, 98.17±0.06, 93.20±0.27). On ChCh-Miner dataset (1514 drugs, 48,514 DDI links), MFFGNN achieved AUROC 97.02±0.25, AUPRC 98.45±0.06, F1 96.94±0.39, significantly better than MIRACLE (96.15±0.29, 95.57±0.19, 92.26±0.09). On DeepDDI dataset (1861 drugs, 192,284 DDI links), MFFGNN achieved AUROC 95.39±0.25, AUPRC 96.81±0.16, F1 92.54±0.61. Cross-dataset experiments demonstrated good generalization performance. Ablation studies showed that removing any feature type (SMILES, molecular graph, or interaction) degraded performance, with best results when all three types were combined.",
  "conclusions": "The proposed MFFGNN model can efficiently integrate information from SMILES sequences, molecular graphs and drug-drug interaction networks for accurate DDI prediction. Multi-type feature fusion significantly improves prediction performance compared to single-feature methods. The model demonstrates good generalization across different dataset scales and maintains effectiveness even with limited labeled data. The gating mechanism effectively prevents over-smoothing in multi-layer graph convolution networks. The framework provides a promising approach for discovering novel drug-drug interactions and may contribute to drug safety assessment in pharmaceutical research.",

  "title": "3D cell culture models: Drug pharmacokinetics, safety assessment, and regulatory consideration",
  "abstract": "Nonclinical testing has served as a foundation for evaluating potential risks and effectiveness of investigational new drugs in humans. However, the current two‐dimensional (2D) in vitro cell culture systems cannot accurately depict and simulate the rich environment and complex processes observed in vivo, whereas animal studies present significant drawbacks with inherited species‐specific differences and low throughput for increased demands. To improve the nonclinical prediction of drug safety and efficacy, researchers continue to develop novel models to evaluate and promote the use of improved cell‐ and organ‐based assays for more accurate representation of human susceptibility to drug response. Among others, the three‐dimensional (3D) cell culture models present physiologically relevant cellular microenvironment and offer great promise for assessing drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PKs) that influence drug safety and efficacy from an early stage of drug development. Currently, there are numerous different types of 3D culture systems, from simple spheroids to more complicated organoids and organs‐on‐chips, and from single‐cell type static 3D models to cell co‐culture 3D models equipped with microfluidic flow control as well as hybrid 3D systems that combine 2D culture with biomedical microelectromechanical systems. This article reviews the current application and challenges of 3D culture systems in drug PKs, safety, and efficacy assessment, and provides a focused discussion and regulatory perspectives on the liver‐, intestine‐, kidney‐, and neuron‐based 3D cellular models.",

Each system incorporates specific culture conditions, cell types, and analytical endpoints tailored for ADMET evaluation.",
  "results": "Liver MPS demonstrated enhanced and prolonged metabolic activity with large cell quantities (>500,000) enabling PK studies and bioanalytical assays.

HepaRG spheroids achieved drug metabolism enzymatic activities comparable to primary human hepatocytes with markedly enhanced cytotoxicity for metabolically activated compounds. MPCC systems maintained hepatic function over 4 weeks and accurately predicted metabolic stability of low turnover compounds like faldaprevir. Duodenum Organ-Chips showed gene expression of major transporters and CYP3A4 comparable to adult human duodenum. CHIM retained robust drug-metabolizing enzyme activities for multiple P450 isoforms and demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity patterns matching human in vivo responses.

These systems offer complex microphysiological environments superior to 2D systems and allow for drug safety evaluation of low clearance drugs, multiple dosing studies, and collection of critical PK data for mechanistic modeling. However, each model presents inherent advantages and limitations requiring further improvement and careful data interpretation.

## Deep Analysis of ADMET Literature Relevance Assessment

### 1. Core Problem Analysis

The thought reveals a critical challenge in literature curation for ADMET prediction research: **distinguishing between directly relevant and tangentially related publications**. The paper "Employing Molecular Conformations for Ligand-Based Virtual Screening with Equivariant Graph Neural Network and Deep Multiple Instance Learning" presents a classic case of methodological overlap without topical alignment.

### 2. Relevance Assessment Framework

**Primary Relevance Indicators:**
- **Topic Alignment**: Medium (30-40%) - Drug discovery context but focused on virtual screening
- **Methodological Relevance**: High (80-90%) - Graph neural networks are core ADMET prediction tools
- **Technical Innovation**: High - Novel EquiVS approach with conformational awareness
- **Practical Applicability**: Medium - Techniques transferable but not directly applicable

**Classification**: **Tangentially Relevant** - Valuable for methodological insights but not core ADMET research

### 3. Structured Metadata Extraction Strategy

The thought correctly identifies the need for systematic extraction of:

1. **Bibliographic Data**: Title, authors, journal, publication year
2. **Content Structure**: Abstract, keywords, methods, results, conclusions
3. **Technical Elements**: Algorithms, datasets, performance metrics
4. **Contextual Information**: Research objectives, limitations, future work

### 4. Key Implications and Connections

**For ADMET Research Community:**
- **Methodological Transfer**: Graph neural network architectures could enhance ADMET models
- **Conformational Awareness**: Multiple conformations approach relevant for ADMET property prediction
- **Multi-Instance Learning**: Potentially applicable to ADMET datasets with multiple molecular```json

  "title": "Employing Molecular Conformations for Ligand-Based Virtual Screening with Equivariant Graph Neural Network and Deep Multiple Instance Learning",
  "abstract": "Ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) is a promising approach for rapid and low-cost screening of potentially bioactive molecules in the early stage of drug discovery. Compared with traditional similarity-based machine learning methods, deep learning frameworks for LBVS can more effectively extract high-order molecule structure representations from molecular fingerprints or structures. However, the 3D conformation of a molecule largely influences its bioactivity and physical properties, and has rarely been considered in previous deep learning-based LBVS methods. Moreover, the relative bioactivity benchmark dataset is still lacking. To address these issues, we introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning architecture trained from molecular conformers for LBVS. We first extracted molecule conformers from multiple public molecular bioactivity data and consolidated them into a large-scale bioactivity benchmark dataset, which totally includes millions of endpoints and molecules corresponding to 954 targets. Then, we devised a deep learning-based LBVS called EquiVS to learn molecule representations from conformers for bioactivity prediction. Specifically, graph convolutional network (GCN) and equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) are sequentially stacked to learn high-order molecule-level and conformer-level representations, followed with attention-based deep multiple-instance learning (MIL) to aggregate these representations and then predict the potential bioactivity for the query molecule on a given target. We conducted various experiments to validate the data quality of our benchmark dataset, and confirmed EquiVS achieved better performance compared with 10 traditional machine learning or deep learning-based LBVS methods. Further ablation studies demonstrate the significant contribution of molecular conformation for bioactivity prediction, as well as the reasonability and non-redundancy of deep learning architecture in EquiVS. Finally, a model interpretation case study on CDK2 shows the potential of EquiVS in optimal conformer discovery. The overall study shows that our proposed benchmark dataset and EquiVS method have promising prospects in virtual screening applications.",
  "keywords": ["virtual screening", "bioactivity prediction", "equivariant graph neural network", "multiple instance learning", "molecular conformation", "benchmark dataset"],
  "methods": "We collected large-scale molecular bioactivity data from five public databases, including ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, Probes and Drugs, and IUPHAR/BPS. We proposed a multilevel data filtering strategy to identify high-quality bioactivity data. For bioactivity data, we selected endpoints with five widely used activity types (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, and Potency). For molecular structure, we adopted MolVS for structure standardization. For biological targets, we only selected those targets with more than 300 bioactivity endpoints. We used RDKit package to generate and optimize molecular conformers using ETKDG method with different random initializations to generate 10 conformers for each molecule. We optimized the generated molecular conformers using MMFF94 force field. We proposed an EGNN and deep MIL-based virtual screening method, EquiVS. The architecture comprises two core modules: the graph representation learning module and the deep multiple instance learning module. A GCN layer is first used to learn graph topological representations, then L EGNN layers were used to learn structural representations for each conformer. We built skip connections between different EGNN layers to allow direct gradient propagation. We introduced MIL theory into bioactivity prediction with an interpretable attention mechanism.",
  "results": "We examined the quality of our constructed bioactivity benchmark dataset through visualization analysis. Our adopted five bioactivity types make up 87.56% of the data. Only 12.4% of bioactivity endpoints are duplicated, and the majority are unique. We trained EquiVS and 10 baseline models on our organized bioactivity benchmark dataset. EquiVS outperformed other baseline methods and achieved optimal performances on 3 metrics. On MSE, the relative improvement of EquiVS compared with the suboptimal method (GBDT_ECFP) is 13.33%. We set R2≥0.7 as the threshold and filtered 1702 (82.98%) feasible targets. EquiVS showed more significant superiority on good-quality targets. Compared to methods with suboptimal performances, the relative improvements of R2, MSE, and MAE of EquiVS reached 3.60%, 33.01%, and 5.45%, respectively. In ablation study, compared to EquiVS-Single, EquiVS gained relative improvements of 7.79% on R2, 35.14% on MSE, and 27.94% on MAE. Compared to EquiVS-w/o AA, EquiVS gained relative improvements of 90.67% on R2, 80.84% on MSE, and 63.70% on MAE.",
  "conclusions": "In this study, we investigate the role of molecular conformation in LBVS and bioactivity prediction scenarios. A large-scale bioactivity prediction benchmark dataset is proposed which contains thousands of targets and millions of bioactivity endpoints, molecules, and molecule conformers. An EGNN and deep MIL-based LBVS method is designed for bioactivity prediction, called EquiVS. Compared to other widely-used ML-based and GNN-based methods, EquiVS achieved notable improvements on our large-scale benchmark dataset. The performance results prove employing molecular conformation could enhance molecular representation learning and further contribute to better bioactivity prediction with elaborate neural network architecture design. The overall results reveal a promising prospect of molecular conformation as well as our proposed benchmark dataset and EquiVS method in bioactivity prediction and LBVS.",

  "title": "Predicting ADMET Properties from Molecule SMILE: A Bottom-Up Approach Using Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "Understanding the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of candidate drugs is crucial for their success. One key aspect is the characterization of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties, which require early assessment in the drug discovery and development process. This study aims to present an innovative approach for predicting ADMET properties using attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs). The model utilizes a graph-based representation of molecules directly derived from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILE) notation. Information is processed sequentially, from substructures to the whole molecule, employing a bottom-up approach. The developed GNN is tested and compared with existing approaches using six benchmark datasets and by encompassing regression (lipophilicity and aqueous solubility) and classification (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibition) tasks. Results show the effectiveness of our model, which bypasses the computationally expensive retrieval and selection of molecular descriptors. This approach provides a valuable tool for high-throughput screening, facilitating early assessment of ADMET properties and enhancing the likelihood of drug success in the development pipeline.",
  "keywords": ["model-based drug development", "ADMET prediction", "graph neural network", "attention-based architecture"],
  "methods": "The study develops an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) approach for predicting ADMET properties from molecular SMILES notation. Each molecule is represented as a graph where nodes represent atoms and edges represent bonds. The GNN architecture consists of three modules: Module 1 focuses on molecular substructures using four parallel branches processing different bond types (single, double, triple, aromatic) through multi-head attention layers. Module 2 considers the whole molecular structure using the complete adjacency matrix. Module 3 uses fully connected neural networks for final prediction. The model employs a bottom-up approach, analyzing substructures before aggregating to whole molecule representation. Multi-head attention layers enable the network to focus on important molecular features. Custom loss functions include weighted RMSE for regression tasks and weighted binary cross-entropy for classification tasks to handle imbalanced datasets. The framework was implemented using Python 3.7 and TensorFlow 2.4.",
  "results": "The GNN framework was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation on six benchmark datasets covering regression (lipophilicity and aqueous solubility) and classification (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 inhibition) tasks. For lipophilicity prediction, the model achieved RMSE of 0.576±0.031, MAE of 0.422±0.019, and R² of 0.774±0.031. For aqueous solubility, results were RMSE of 1.14±0.050, MAE of 0.749±0.020, and R² of 0.767±0.023. Classification tasks showed strong performance with AUROC values: CYP2C9 (0.894±0.009), CYP2C19 (0.882±0.006), CYP2D6 (0.862±0.008), and CYP3A4 (0.887±0.011). AUPRC values were 0.790±0.01, 0.859±0.008, 0.676±0.014, and 0.842±0.014 respectively. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of substructure processing and attention mechanisms, with the complete model consistently outperforming simplified variants.",
  "conclusions": "The study successfully demonstrates that attention-based graph neural networks can effectively predict ADMET properties directly from SMILES notation without requiring computationally expensive molecular descriptors. The bottom-up approach, processing molecular substructures before whole molecule analysis, proves superior to simpler alternatives. The model achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple ADMET prediction tasks. The attention mechanism provides both performance enhancement and interpretability, addressing key requirements in pharmaceutical applications. This approach offers significant advantages for high-throughput screening and early drug discovery, potentially reducing development costs and improving success rates. The methodology represents a promising avenue for enhancing ADMET prediction accuracy and emphasizes the importance of leveraging innovative computational approaches in drug discovery.",

  "title": "A multi-task FP-GNN framework enables accurate prediction of selective PARP inhibitors",
  "abstract": "PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) family is a crucial DNA repair enzyme that responds to DNA damage, regulates apoptosis, and maintains genome stability; therefore, PARP inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various human diseases including COVID-19. In this study, a multi-task FP-GNN (Fingerprint and Graph Neural Networks) deep learning framework was proposed to predict the inhibitory activity of molecules against four PARP isoforms (PARP-1, PARP-2, PARP-5A, and PARP-5B). Compared with baseline predictive models based on four conventional machine learning methods such as RF, SVM, XGBoost, and LR as well as six deep learning algorithms such as DNN, Attentive FP, MPNN, GAT, GCN, and D-MPNN, the evaluation results indicate that the multi-task FP-GNN method achieves the best performance with the highest average BA, F1, and AUC values of 0.753 ± 0.033, 0.910 ± 0.045, and 0.888 ± 0.016 for the test set. In addition, Y-scrambling testing successfully verified that the model was not results of chance correlation. More importantly, the interpretability of the multi-task FP-GNN model enabled the identification of key structural fragments associated with the inhibition of each PARP isoform. To facilitate the use of the multi-task FP-GNN model in the field, an online webserver called PARPi-Predict and its local version software were created to predict whether compounds bear potential inhibitory activity against PARPs, thereby contributing to design and discover better selective PARP inhibitors.",
  "keywords": ["PARP", "deep learning", "multi-task FP-GNN", "interpretability", "online webserver"],
  "methods": "A multi-task FP-GNN model was developed to establish classification models for predicting active molecules against four PARPs. The FP-GNN algorithm simultaneously learns molecular graph information and fixed prior molecular fingerprints information to better predict molecular properties, including molecular physicochemical properties, biological activities, and ADMET properties. Graph-based module employs a spatial graph neural network (GNN) with attention mechanism to acquire structural information in molecular graphs, while the fingerprint-based network module uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn information from two substructure-based molecular fingerprints (PubChem FP and MACCS FP) as well as a pharmacophore-based fingerprint (Pharmacophore ErG FP). The multi-task FP-GNN adopts the parameter sharing multi-task learning method, inherits the molecular graph and molecular fingerprints modules from the single task model, and extends the fusion module into a multi-task output module. During training, Bayesian optimization method was used to optimize hyperparameters including Dropout, dropout gat, dim, gat scale, nheads, and nhid. To eliminate randomness and ensure generalization capacity, 10 independent runs with different seeds were performed to train and evaluate the models.",
  "results": "The multi-task FP-GNN method achieved the best performance with the highest average BA, F1, and AUC values of 0.753 ± 0.033, 0.910 ± 0.045, and 0.888 ± 0.016 for the test set. Compared with baseline predictive models based on four conventional machine learning methods (RF, SVM, XGBoost, and LR) and six deep learning algorithms (DNN, Attentive FP, MPNN, GAT, GCN, and D-MPNN), the multi-task FP-GNN model outperformed all other models. The fingerprint-based models achieved better performance on the test set for each PARP isoform, with average values of BA, F1 score and AUC greater than 0.65, 0.85 and 0.65, respectively. Among fingerprint-based models, LR:Morgan models performed the best with the highest average values of BA (0.735 ± 0.047), SP (0.554 ± 0.095), and MCC (0.493 ± 0.085). Graph-based DL models were inferior to fingerprint-based ML models due to insufficient PARP modelling datasets. Y-scrambling testing confirmed that the results were not chance correlations.",
  "conclusions": "A multi-task FP-GNN model was successfully developed to predict the inhibitory activity of molecules against four PARP isoforms with superior performance compared to baseline models. The interpretability of the multi-task FP-GNN model allows researchers to pinpoint critical structural fragments associated with PARP subtype inhibition. An online platform (PARPi-Predict) and its local version software were established to facilitate the design and discovery of new selective PARP inhibitors. The multi-task learning strategy exploits the linkages between various subtasks while recognizing their distinctions, improving fault tolerance and prediction accuracy. Future work will focus on incorporating pre-trained methods and protein information to further enhance the model performance.",

  "title": "Conceptual DFT-Based Computational Peptidology, Pharmacokinetics Study and ADMET Report of the Veraguamides A–G Family of Marine Natural Drugs",
  "abstract": "As a continuation of our research on the chemical reactivity, pharmacokinetics and ADMET properties of cyclopeptides of marine origin with potential therapeutic abilities, in this work our already presented integrated molecular modeling protocol has been used for the study of the chemical reactivity and bioactivity properties of the Veraguamides A–G family of marine natural drugs. This protocol results from the estimation of the conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) chemical reactivity descriptors together with several chemoinformatics tools commonly considered within the process of development of new therapeutic drugs. CP-CDFT is a branch of computational chemistry and molecular modeling dedicated to the study of peptides, and it is a protocol that allows the estimation with great accuracy of the CDFT-based reactivity descriptors and the associated physical and chemical properties, which can aid in determining the ability of the studied peptides to behave as potential useful drugs. Moreover, the superiority of the MN12SX density functional over other long-range corrected density functionals for the prediction of chemical and physical properties in the presence of water as the solvent is clearly demonstrated. The research was supplemented with an investigation of the bioactivity of the molecular systems and their ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) parameters, as is customary in medicinal chemistry. Some instances of the CDFT-based chemical reactivity descriptors' capacity to predict the pKas of peptides as well as their potential as AGE inhibitors are also shown.",
  "keywords": ["Veraguamides A–G", "computational peptidology", "conceptual DFT", "KID (Koopmans In DFT)", "ADMET", "computational pharmacokinetics"],
  "methods": "The Kohn-Sham (KS) methodology involves the electronic density, the determination of the molecular energy, and the orbital energies of a specific system, in particular, the HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals which are intrinsically related to the chemical reactivity of the molecules. The conformers of the cyclic hexadepsipeptides were established using MarvinView 17.15 from ChemAxon, which was applied in order to undertake molecular mechanics calculations utilizing the MMFF94 force field with an energy window of 0.1 kcal/mol. This was followed by a geometry optimization and frequency calculation using the density functional tight binding (DFTBA) methodology. The determination of the electronic properties and the reactivity descriptors of the Veraguamides A–G addressed the MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O model chemistry because it has been previously shown that it verifies the KID procedure and satisfies the ionization energy theorem, with the aid of the Gaussian 16 software and the SMD solvation model. The SMILES notation of the cyclopeptides were acquired by accessing the PubChem database, and then were fed into the online program Chemicalize from ChemAxon, which was considered to get a glimpse of the potential therapeutic properties of the studied molecular systems. A similarity search in the chemical space of compounds with molecular structures that could be compared to the ones being studied, with already known biological and pharmacological properties, was achieved through the online Molinspiration software from Molinspiration Cheminformatics. SwissTargetPrediction is an online tool for the prediction of protein targets of small compounds, and it was used to estimate the potential bioactivity of the marine cyclopeptides studied in this research. Chemicalize and the internet-available SwissADME program were used to estimate some ADMET parameters in this study. pkCSM, software for the prediction of small-molecule pharmacokinetic properties using SMILES that can be accessed through its linked webpage, was also used to obtain additional information regarding the pharmacokinetics parameters and ADMET indices.",
  "results": "The results from Table 1 are very interesting because they show that there are various degrees in the fulfillment of the Janak and ionization energy theorems for the different long-range corrected density functionals involved.

  "abstract": "Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019 and the pandemic continues for more than one year, a vast amount of drug research has been conducted and few of them got FDA approval. Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a pipeline that systematically integrates the interaction between COVID-19 and drugs, deep graph neural networks, and in vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all available drugs (n = 3635) related to COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a COVID-19 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate drug's representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and population-based treatment effect. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep neural networks, and multiple evidence can facilitate the rapid identification of candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.",
  "keywords": ["Drug development", "Virtual screening"],
  "methods": "We built a comprehensive COVID-19 knowledge graph that represents interactions between SARS-CoV-2 baits, host genes, pathways, targets, drugs (including experimental compounds), and phenotype. We then derived embedding for each drug, gene, phenotype, and SARS-CoV-2 bait using GNN. The GNN embedding method was the variational graph autoencoder with multi-relational edges. We used variational graph autoencoders with GraphSAGE messages passing. The graph autoencoder method is an unsupervised learning framework to encode the nodes into a latent vector (embedding) and reconstruct the given graph structure (i.e., graph adjacency matrix) with the encoded latent vector. We set different weight matrices for each of the five types of edges. We set the embedding size as 128 after several trials. We used PyTorch Geometric for implementation. We further boosted the representativeness of the embedding by transferring DRKG universal embedding to our embedding.",
  "results": "We first built a comprehensive COVID-19 knowledge graph that represents interactions between SARS-CoV-2 baits, host genes, pathways, targets, drugs and phenotype. Our node embedding showed high accuracy in predicting the relation in the COVID-19 knowledge graph. The initial DRKG universal embedding achieved 0.5695 AUROC and 0.6431 AUPRC. After fine-tuning the DRKG embedding to the COVID-19 knowledge graph, we achieved AUROC 0.8121 and AUPRC 0.8524, respectively. The ranking model accuracy was AUROC between 0.77 and 0.90 and AUPRC between 0.17 and 0.25. From the initial drug ranking, we selected the top 300 highly-ranked drugs as potential repurposable candidates. We identified 183 statistically significant drugs including Gefitinib, Chlorpromazine, Dexamethasone, Rimexolone, and Naltrexone. We highlighted the most promising drugs as the top 21 drugs include anti-infection, immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory, antiviral, anti-fever, antihypertensive, anti-cancer drugs, anticoagulant drugs.",
  "conclusions": "This study proposes an integrative drug repurposing pipeline for the rapid identification of drugs and their combination to treat COVID-19. Our pipelines were developed from extensive SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural representation, and ranking model, and validated from genetic profiles, in vitro efficacy, and population-based treatment effects. From a translational perspective, this pipeline can provide a general network pharmacology pipeline for various diseases, which can contribute to fast drug and drug combinations repurposing.",

  "title": "Insights into the Structural Patterns in Human Glioblastoma Cell Line SF268 Activity and ADMET Prediction of Curcumin Derivatives",
  "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Curcumin is a promising therapy for glioblastoma but is limited by poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and low blood–brain barrier penetration. This study aimed to evaluate curcumin and six curcumin derivatives with improved activity against a glioblastoma cell line and favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Methods: Twenty-one curcumin derivatives were assessed and subjected to in vitro MTT cytotoxicity assays in SF268 glioblastoma and Vero cells. On the basis of the cytotoxicity results, six derivatives with the most favorable characteristics were selected for additional mechanistic studies, which included microtubule depolymerization, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and BAX activation assays. ADMET properties were determined in silico. Results: Compounds 2–4, 6, and 11 demonstrated better activity (IC50: 0.59–3.97 µg/mL and SI: 3–20) than curcumin (IC50: 6.3 µg/mL; SI: 2.5). Lead derivatives destabilized microtubules, induced ΔΨm collapse, and activated BAX. In silico ADMET prediction analysis revealed that compounds 4 and 6 were the most promising for oral administration from a biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic point of view. Conclusions: Strategic modifications were made to one or both hydroxyl groups of the aromatic rings of curcumin to increase its physicochemical stability and activity against glioblastoma cell line SF268. Compound 4, bearing fully protected aromatic domains, was identified as a prime candidate for in vivo validation and formulation development.",

  "methods": "Twenty-one curcumin derivatives were purified using HPLC with normal phase silica gel column. SF268 glioblastoma cells and Vero epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using MTT assays at multiple concentrations for 48h. Mechanistic studies included tubulin polymerization assays using fluorescence-based kit, immunofluorescence staining of microtubules and BAX protein, mitochondrial membrane potential measurements using DiOC6 dye, and ROS production analysis with DCFDA. ADMET properties were predicted using SwissADME and ADMET Predictor software versions 10.4 and 11.0. Physicochemical properties were analyzed using Lipinski's and Veber's rules. Pharmacokinetic simulations were performed with single human oral dose of 10 mg over 168 hours. Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with GraphPad Prism 9.0.",

Compounds 2-4, 6, 11, and 19 showed remarkable activity with low toxicity to normal cells. All selected compounds disrupted microtubule assembly, inhibited tubulin polymerization similar to calcium chloride control, and caused mitochondrial membrane potential collapse without ROS production. Treatment increased proapoptotic BAX protein levels. ADMET predictions showed compounds 1-4 and 6 adhered to Lipinski's rule with molecular weights <500 g/mol. Compounds 4 and 6 had absorbed fractions >50% and bioavailable fractions >50%. All compounds were predicted to slowly cross blood-brain barrier and not leak through hERG channels.

  "title": "DeepDrug as an expert guided and AI driven drug repurposing methodology for selecting the lead combination of drugs for Alzheimer's disease",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) significantly aggravates human dignity and quality of life. While newly approved amyloid immunotherapy has been reported, effective AD drugs remain to be identified. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven drug-repurposing method, DeepDrug, to identify a lead combination of approved drugs to treat AD patients. DeepDrug advances drug-repurposing methodology in four aspects. Firstly, it incorporates expert knowledge to extend candidate targets to include long genes, immunological and aging pathways, and somatic mutation markers that are associated with AD. Secondly, it incorporates a signed directed heterogeneous biomedical graph encompassing a rich set of nodes and edges, and node/edge weighting to capture crucial pathways associated with AD. Thirdly, it encodes the weighted biomedical graph through a Graph Neural Network into a new embedding space to capture the granular relationships across different nodes. Fourthly, it systematically selects the high-order drug combinations via diminishing return-based thresholds. A five-drug lead combination, consisting of Tofacitinib, Niraparib, Baricitinib, Empagliflozin, and Doxercalciferol, has been selected from the top drug candidates based on DeepDrug scores to achieve the maximum synergistic effect. These five drugs target neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glucose metabolism, which are all related to AD pathology. DeepDrug offers a novel AI-and-big-data, expert-guided mechanism for new drug combination discovery and drug-repurposing across AD and other neuro-degenerative diseases, with immediate clinical applications.",

  "methods": "DeepDrug consists of a three-stage methodology. First, construction of a heterogeneous directed biomedical graph consisting of interconnected genes, proteins, and drugs to capture network characteristics of AD pathology. The graph includes four types of nodes (genes, proteins, drugs, drug targets) and four types of edges (gene-protein, protein-protein, drug-target, drug-drug). Expert knowledge was incorporated to determine edge directions, signs, and weights. Second, the biomedical graph is input to a Graph Neural Network framework using a signed directed graph autoencoder to create embeddings of drug and gene nodes in lower dimensional space. The GNN uses signed GCN and directed GCN layers with pathway-guided regularization. Third, drug scoring and selection analysis generates drug-gene scores and identifies lead drug combinations. Drug-gene scores are calculated using cosine similarity between drug and gene embeddings, with systematic selection of high-order drug combinations via diminishing return-based thresholds.",
  "results": "DeepDrug identified top 15 drug candidates with Tofacitinib ranking first (score 0.2692), followed by Niraparib (0.1528) and Palbociclib (0.1454). Three of the top five drugs are JAK kinase inhibitors. The GNN model achieved >97% classification accuracy (AUC=0.977, AP=0.979) in link prediction tasks. A five-drug lead combination was selected: Tofacitinib, Niraparib, Baricitinib, Empagliflozin, and Doxercalciferol (combined score 0.3876). Statistical analysis showed the lead combination score was significantly different from other combinations (Wilcoxon test p=0.006). The combination targets neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glucose metabolism pathways. Existing approved AD drugs ranked low: Memantine (55th), Donepezil (83rd), Galantamine (159th), Rivastigmine (264th), Lecanemab (403rd), and Aducanumab (405th).",
  "conclusions": "DeepDrug successfully identified a lead five-drug combination for AD treatment through expert-guided AI-driven drug repurposing. The framework incorporates domain-specific knowledge into heterogeneous signed directed biomedical graphs and uses GNN to capture complex relationships. The selected drugs target multiple AD-related pathways including neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glucose metabolism. The approach offers a novel mechanism for drug combination discovery and repurposing across neurodegenerative diseases with immediate clinical applications. The low rankings of current approved AD drugs highlight the importance of incorporating expert-led insights and targeting multiple pathways rather than focusing solely on amyloid beta.",

  "abstract": "Forty-four bicyclo ((aryl) methyl) benzamides, acting as glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors, are developed using molecular modeling techniques. QSAR models generated by multiple linear and non-linear regressions affirm that the biological inhibitory activity against the schizophrenia disease is strongly and significantly correlated with physicochemical, geometrical and topological descriptors, in particular: Hydrogen bond donor, polarizability, surface tension, stretch and torsion energies and topological diameter. According to in silico ADMET properties, the most active ligands (L6, L9, L30, L31 and L37) are the molecules having the highest probability of penetrating the central nervous system (CNS), but the molecule 32 has the highest probability of being absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Molecular docking results indicate that Tyr124, Phe43, Phe325, Asp46, Phe319 and Val120 amino acids are the active sites of the dopamine transporter (DAT) membrane protein, in which the most active ligands can inhibit the glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1). The results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed that all five inhibitors remained stable in the active sites of the DAT protein during 100 ns, demonstrating their promising role as candidate drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia.",
  "keywords": ["GlyT1", "QSAR", "schizophrenia", "ADMET", "molecular docking", "DAT", "MD"],

Both models showed external validation coefficients >0.6 (R²ext=0.63 for MLR, R²ext=0.68 for MNLR). Six molecular descriptors significantly affected biological activity: polarizability, surface tension, torsion energy, hydrogen bond donor, stretch energy, and topological diameter. ADMET prediction revealed that ligands L6, L9, L30, L31, and L37 had favorable profiles with >91% intestinal absorption, good BBB permeability (Log BB >-1), and CNS penetration capability. All compounds respected Lipinski, Veber, Egan, and Ghose rules except L32. Molecular docking showed binding energies ranging from -8.46 to -10.74 kcal/mol, with key interactions involving Tyr124, Phe43, Phe325, Asp46, Phe319, and Val120 amino acids. MD simulations confirmed stable protein-ligand complexes with RMSD fluctuations of 1-3 Å over 100 ns.",

These compounds demonstrated excellent CNS penetration probability, non-toxic profiles, and stable binding to the dopamine transporter protein. The validated QSAR models provide reliable predictions for future drug design, while molecular docking and dynamics studies confirm the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors. However, in vitro and in vivo investigations are required to evaluate their efficacy and safety as anti-schizophrenia drugs.",

  "title": "Multi-Targeted Molecular Docking, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug-Likeness Evaluation of Okra-Derived Ligand Abscisic Acid Targeting Signaling Proteins Involved in the Development of Diabetes",
  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a global threat affecting millions of people of different age groups. In recent years, the development of naturally derived anti-diabetic agents has gained popularity. Okra is a common vegetable containing important bioactive components such as abscisic acid (ABA). ABA, a phytohormone, has been shown to elicit potent anti-diabetic effects in mouse models. Keeping its anti-diabetic potential in mind, in silico study was performed to explore its role in inhibiting proteins relevant to diabetes mellitus- 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1), aldose reductase, glucokinase, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), and Sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases 6 (SIRT6). A comparative study of the ABA-protein docked complex with already known inhibitors of these proteins relevant to diabetes was compared to explore the inhibitory potential. Calculation of molecular binding energy (ΔG), inhibition constant (pKi), and prediction of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties were performed. The molecular docking investigation of ABA with 11-HSD1, GFAT, PPAR-gamma, and SIRT6 revealed considerably low binding energy (ΔG from −8.1 to −7.3 Kcal/mol) and predicted inhibition constant (pKi from 6.01 to 5.21 µM). The ADMET study revealed that ABA is a promising drug candidate without any hazardous effect following all current drug-likeness guidelines such as Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan, and Muegge.",
  "keywords": ["anti-diabetic", "okra", "abscisic acid", "nutraceuticals", "Diabetes mellitus", "molecular docking", "phytohormones"],
  "methods": "The human proteins related to diabetes mellitus were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The ligand molecule ABA was downloaded from PubChem and converted into 3D format using Chem3D 16.0. Molecular docking calculations were performed using AutoDock Vina version 4.2 software suite. The receptor proteins were solvated with water, and only polar hydrogens were added. Flexible Ligand docking was performed applying the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm with an exhaustiveness value of eight. Post-docking protein-ligand interaction analysis was performed using PyMOL software and Discovery Studio client. The inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated using the formula Ki = exp(ΔG/(R × T)). Pharmacodynamics properties were screened using molinspiration online server. ADMET evaluation was performed using pkCSM, SwissADME and ADMETLAB2.0 web tools to evaluate pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry properties.",
  "results": "ABA showed binding energies ranging from −8.1 to −6.2 kcal/mol with nine diabetes-related proteins. The best binding was observed with 11β-HSD1 (−8.1 kcal/mol, pKi 6.01 µM), followed by GFAT, PPAR-gamma, and SIRT6 (all −7.3 kcal/mol, pKi 5.21 µM). Key hydrogen bond interactions were identified with active site residues. The bioactivity scores showed high values for nuclear receptor ligand (1.06), enzyme inhibitor (0.75), and ion channel modulator (0.28). ADMET analysis revealed high human intestinal absorption (96.712%), very low BBB permeability (−0.047 log BB), and no inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. ABA showed no AMES toxicity, hepatotoxicity, or skin sensitization. The compound satisfied all drug-likeness rules including Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan, and Muegge with optimal physicochemical properties.",
  "conclusions": "Molecular docking investigation of ABA with nine different protein targets relevant to diabetes mellitus revealed four potential target proteins that perfectly dock with ABA. Based on binding energy and predicted inhibition constant, 11β-HSD1 showed best binding with ABA, followed by GFAT, PPAR-gamma, and SIRT6. Following all current drug-likeness guidelines, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features with ADMET study revealed that ABA could be the best molecule without any hazardous effect. ABA can be considered a potential candidate for developing a potent anti-diabetic drug and a promising bioactive compound of okra for developing nutraceuticals and functional foods.",

  "title": "BioPathNet: Enhancing Link Prediction in Biomedical Knowledge Graphs through Path Representation Learning",
  "abstract": "Understanding complex interactions in biomedical networks is crucial for advancements in biomedicine, but traditional link prediction (LP) methods are limited in capturing this complexity. Representation-based learning techniques improve prediction accuracy by mapping nodes to low-dimensional embeddings, yet they often struggle with interpretability and scalability. We present BioPathNet, a novel graph neural network framework based on the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), addressing these limitations through path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs. Unlike node-embedding frameworks, BioPathNet learns representations between node pairs by considering all relations along paths, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability. This allows visualization of influential paths and facilitates biological validation. BioPathNet leverages a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and uses stringent negative sampling to improve precision. In evaluations across various LP tasks, such as gene function annotation, drug-disease indication, synthetic lethality, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction prediction, BioPathNet consistently outperformed shallow node embedding methods, relational graph neural networks and task-specific state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robust performance and versatility. Our study predicts novel drug indications for diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Alzheimer's, validated by medical experts and clinical trials. We also identified new synthetic lethality gene pairs and regulatory interactions involving lncRNAs and target genes, confirmed through literature reviews. BioPathNet's interpretability will enable researchers to trace prediction paths and gain molecular insights, making it a valuable tool for drug discovery, personalized medicine and biology in general.",
  "keywords": ["biomedical knowledge graph", "link prediction", "graph neural network"],
  "methods": "BioPathNet is a message-passing neural network framework based on the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet) for path representation learning in biomedical knowledge graphs. The method learns representations between node pairs by considering all relations along paths rather than optimizing one-hop relations like traditional node embedding methods. BioPathNet incorporates a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and uses entity type-aware negative sampling where negatives are drawn from the same node type as positives. The framework uses the generalized Bellman-Ford dynamic programming algorithm to compute pair representations efficiently. Path representations are parameterized as the generalized sum of path representations between source and target nodes, with each path representation as the generalized product of edge representations along the path. The method abstracts the boundary condition to an indicator function, multiplication operator to message passing formulation, and summation operator to general aggregation function. For training, negative log-likelihood is minimized between positive samples and negative samples generated by corrupting tail entities.",
  "results": "BioPathNet consistently outperformed baseline methods across four diverse link prediction tasks. In gene function prediction, BioPathNet achieved MRR of 0.464 without BRG and 0.549 with BRG, outperforming KGE methods (average 0.371) and R-GCN (0.348-0.355). For drug repurposing, BioPathNet outperformed TxGNN across all five disease area splits with average AUPRC increase of 20.2%, achieving 61.9% recall at k=20 compared to TxGNN's 53.9%. In synthetic lethality prediction, BioPathNet significantly outperformed KR4SL in both unthresholded and thresholded data for multiple metrics including Recall@10, Precision@10, and NDCG. For lncRNA-target prediction on sparse knowledge graphs, BioPathNet achieved MRR of 0.19 and significantly outperformed node embedding methods (TransE, DistMult) and basic NBFNet across all metrics. The method successfully predicted novel drug indications for Alzheimer's disease, identifying drugs currently in clinical trials like Nicotine and Bupropion, and discovered new synthetic lethality gene pairs like EYA4-MUS81 and POLB-BRCA1.",
  "conclusions": "BioPathNet represents a novel and effective method for link prediction on biological knowledge graphs using path embedding that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse biomedical tasks. Its interpretability framework enables visualization of key prediction paths, enhancing understanding and biological plausibility evaluation. The method's ability to leverage background regulatory graphs and use node type-aware negative sampling makes it particularly suited for noisy biological knowledge graphs. BioPathNet's versatility across gene function prediction, drug repurposing, synthetic lethality, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction tasks demonstrates its broad applicability in biomedical research. Future work could focus on inductive settings, integrating node features, and utilizing condition-specific knowledge graphs enriched with detailed biological knowledge to further enhance reasoning capabilities.",

### 1. Core Analysis Framework

  "title": "Evaluation of Free Online ADMET Tools for Academic or Small Biotech Environments",
  "abstract": "For a new molecular entity (NME) to become a drug, it is not only essential to have the right biological activity also be safe and efficient, but it is also required to have a favorable pharmacokinetic profile including toxicity (ADMET). Consequently, there is a need to predict, during the early stages of development, the ADMET properties to increase the success rate of compounds reaching the lead optimization process. Since Lipinski's rule of five, the prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters has evolved towards the current in silico tools based on empirical approaches or molecular modeling. The commercial specialized software for performing such predictions, which is usually costly, is, in many cases, not among the possibilities for research laboratories in academia or at small biotech companies. Nevertheless, in recent years, many free online tools have become available, allowing, more or less accurately, for the prediction of the most relevant pharmacokinetic parameters. This paper studies 18 free web servers capable of predicting ADMET properties and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages, their model-based calculations, and their degree of accuracy by considering the experimental data reported for a set of 24 FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as a model of a research project.",
  "keywords": ["absorption", "distribution", "metabolism", "elimination", "toxicity", "pharmacokinetics", "in silico predictions", "tyrosine kinase inhibitors", "web servers"],
  "methods": "In this paper, we have analyzed 18 web servers that allow for the prediction of ADMET properties at no economic cost. The characteristics of such applications and the pharmacokinetic parameters they predict have been compiled. A comparative study of the goodness of these predictions has been carried out using the experimental data of 24 FDA-approved TKIs as a model of what a research project of a possible drug candidate would be (narrow distribution of molecular weights close to 500 g/mol). These bibliographic data were obtained from DrugBank (DB), The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), and the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB). The pharmacokinetic predictions for the 24 TKIs were carried out from January to June of 2022. To compare the predictions obtained using the different websites and the experimental data, we needed to homogenize their units and sort the data into binary categories for some parameters. The experimental and predicted data were represented by a box-and-whisker plot or a bar graph, and statistical evaluation was performed by a pairwise t-test carried out by Real Statistics for Excel.",
  "results": "The study evaluated 18 free web servers for ADMET prediction. ADMETlab was identified as the most comprehensive platform offering the best coverage of parameters and accuracy in predictions. For solubility prediction, FAF-Drug4 and OCHEM platforms showed the best fit, while admetSAR, pkCSM, and preADMET gave predictions far from reality. For log P predictions, all websites showed close predictions to experimental values, with SwissADME showing the highest correlation (R2 = 0.62). Absorption prediction was found to be unreliable across all platforms, with most predictions indicating high absorption for all compounds. For plasma protein binding, admetSAR was considered the best predictor. Clearance was one of the best-predicted properties by both ADMETlab and pkCSM. Toxicity predictions showed large variability and absence of patterns across all platforms. The study found that octanol/water coefficient and plasma protein binding were the two best-predicted parameters, followed by clearance, while solubility and absorption showed the worst predicted results.",
  "conclusions": "The high number of failures during drug development due to pharmacokinetic problems makes it essential to predict ADMET properties in initial research phases. None of the webservers cover all relevant physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters, so simultaneous use of several platforms is often needed. ADMETLab offers the best coverage and accuracy. The volatility of free web servers is extremely high due to changes in methodologies and conversion to commercial software. Only a few servers guarantee confidentiality of uploaded structures. Octanol/water coefficient and plasma protein binding are the best-predicted parameters, while solubility and absorption show worst results. Predictions will not avoid experimental evaluation but can help reduce the number of compounds studied and identify failures early in the development process.",

**Core Principle**: **Convergent Validation Through Systematic Integration**

This approach transforms ADMET prediction from an art to a science, providing the foundation for next-generation drug discovery platforms that combine computational efficiency with experimental reliability.

**Strategic Recommendation**: Position your ADMET tools survey as the **definitive guide to implementing convergent validation methodologies**, using the withanolides study as the exemplar of best practices while extending the framework to comprehensive tool ecosystem analysis.

The future of ADMET prediction lies not in finding the "best" tool, but in creating the most **intelligent integration** of available tools—and this study provides the blueprint for that transformation.```json

  "title": "Anticancer Effects of Withanolides: In Silico Prediction of Pharmacological Properties",
  "abstract": "Withanolides are a class of naturally occurring C-28 ergostane steroidal lactones with an abundance of biological activities, and their members are promising candidates for antineoplastic drug development. The ADMET properties of withanolides are still largely unknown, and in silico predictions can play a crucial role highlighting these characteristics for drug development, shortening time and resources spent on the development of a drug lead. In this work, ADMET properties of promising antitumoral withanolides were assessed. Each chemical structure was submitted to the prediction tools: SwissADME, pkCSM–pharmacokinetics, admetSAR v2.0, and Molinspiration Cheminformatics. The results indicate a good gastrointestinal absorption rate, inability to cross the blood–brain barrier, CYP3A4 metabolization, without inhibition of other P450 cytochromes, high interaction with nuclear receptors, and a low toxicity. It was also predicted for the inhibition of pharmacokinetics transporters and some ecotoxicity. This demonstrates a viability for oral drug development, with low probabilities of side effects.",
  "keywords": ["withanolides", "ADMET", "withaferin", "drug development", "cancer", "natural products"],
  "methods": "For this work, we have selected 27 withanolides with reported in vitro antitumoral activity with IC50 lower than 10 µM. The structures were designed using the software ACD/ChemSketch 2020.2.0 (ACD/Labs), and the SMILES notations were generated for use in studies. Each chemical structure from the SMILES notation was submitted for predicting physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity properties using the websites SwissADME (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), pkCSM–pharmacokinetics, admetSAR v2, and Molinspiration Cheminformatics. All the platforms are free access. To compare selected antitumoral withanolides to already described molecules and clinical use drugs, we selected 17 widely used antitumor drugs. The selection tried to be representative of drugs with different molecular targets used in clinics for several tumor types.",
  "results": "The selected withanolides are intended to represent a plethora of subtypes, to better understand the ADMET properties among the different structures. Of the 27 withanolides analyzed, 26 fit the rule of five, and could be predicted with good oral absorption and permeation. Among them, 13 withanolides violated no rule, and 13 withanolides violated one rule, and only 4β-Hydroxyanomanolide violated two rules. Using the BOILED-Egg prediction system, 25 withanolides would be unable to cross the BBB. However, the two sinubrasolides were plotted inside the BBB permeability area. The predicted human intestinal absorption was highly positive for all withanolides. Data obtained using in silico predictions indicate that CYP3A4 is probably the main CYP responsible for withanolide metabolism. Predictions suggest that withanolides do not interact with CYP2D6. The majority of withanolides could not inhibit the CYPs available for calculation. Withanolides have shown a homogenous prediction concerning the MATE-1 inhibition. All withanolides were predicted, with high probability, to be unable to inhibit the functioning of the MATE-1 protein.",
  "conclusions": "Withanolides are molecules with good antitumoral potential, being studied as drug candidates worldwide. Considering some limitations, the in silico predictions demonstrated good oral absorption, possibly a low toxicity, a common CYP3A4 metabolization, low inhibition of pharmacokinetics transporters, high probability of nuclear receptor interactions, and a high alert for aquatic environments ecotoxicity. In summary, the predictions evaluated some positive characteristics that need to be further investigated and confirmed using in vitro and in vivo assays during the drug development process. Our predictions can guide and stimulate the research process for the pharmacological characteristics of withanolides.",

## Deep Analysis of Literature Relevance Assessment

### Core Analysis Framework

Your thought demonstrates a systematic approach to evaluating literature relevance for ADMET prediction research. Let me break down the analytical structure and provide insights:

### 1. **Relevance Assessment Methodology**

**Strengths in Your Approach:**
- **Multi-dimensional evaluation**: You correctly assessed topic matching, methodological relevance, application domain, temporal relevance, and innovation value
- **Objective scoring framework**: The 0.3-0.4 relevance score reflects appropriate calibration
- **Clear distinction**: You properly differentiated between related biomedical applications and direct ADMET prediction

**Key Insight**: Your assessment correctly identifies that proximity to the domain (biomedical prediction) doesn't automatically translate to high relevance for specific applications (ADMET).

### 2. **Critical Evaluation Points**

**Topic Matching Analysis:**
- BioPathNet focuses on knowledge graph link prediction
- Four application tasks identified, with drug repositioning being most relevant
- Correctly noted the distinction between drug-disease relationship prediction vs. ADMET property prediction

**Methodological Considerations:**
- Graph neural networks could potentially be adapted for ADMET prediction
- Path-based reasoning might offer novel approaches to molecular property prediction
- However, the current implementation targets different prediction tasks

### 3. **Implications and Connections**

**Potential Value Despite Low Direct Relevance:**
1. **Methodological Transfer**: The path-based reasoning approach could inspire ADMET prediction methodologies
2. **Knowledge Integration**: Framework for incorporating diverse biomedical knowledge into prediction models
3. **Multi-task Learning**: Potential for extending to include ADMET properties alongside current tasks

**Research Gap Identification:**
- Your analysis reveals the need for more direct ADMET-focused knowledge graph approaches
- Highlights opportunity for adapting advanced graph methods to pharmaceutical property prediction

### 4. **Structured Metadata Extraction Strategy**

Your systematic approach to extracting:
- Title, Abstract, Keywords
- Methods, Results, Conclusions
- Demonstrates proper literature processing methodology

### 5. **Actionable Conclusions**

**For Literature Review Process:**
1. **Maintain strict relevance criteria** - Your 0.3-0.4 scoring appropriately reflects limited direct applicability
2. **Document methodological potential** - Note techniques that could be adapted even if not directly applicable
3. **Create relevance categories** - Distinguish between direct, methodologically relevant, and tangentially related literature

**For Research Direction:**
1. **Identify adaptation opportunities** - Consider how path-based reasoning could enhance ADMET prediction
2. **Knowledge graph integration** - Explore incorporating ADMET-relevant biomedical knowledge
3. **Benchmark comparison** - Use as baseline for evaluating ADMET-specific graph neural network approaches

### 6. **Quality Assurance Recommendations**

**Validation Steps:**
- Cross-reference with ADMET-specific terminology in the full text
- Verify that drug repositioning tasks don't include ADMET considerations
- Confirm temporal relevance (2024 publication meets "recent five years" criterion)

**Consistency Checks:**
- Ensure scoring aligns with established relevance criteria
- Maintain objectivity despite methodological sophistication
- Document reasoning for future reference and consistency

### Strategic Insight

Your analytical approach demonstrates excellent scientific rigor in literature evaluation.

  "title": "Path-based reasoning for biomedical knowledge graphs with BioPathNet",
  "abstract": "Understanding complex interactions in biomedical networks is crucial for advancements in biomedicine, but traditional link prediction (LP) methods are limited in capturing this complexity. Representation-based learning techniques improve prediction accuracy by mapping nodes to low-dimensional embeddings, yet they often struggle with interpretability and scalability. We present BioPathNet, a novel graph neural network framework based on the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), addressing these limitations through path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs. Unlike node-embedding frameworks, BioPathNet learns representations between node pairs by considering all relations along paths, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability. This allows visualization of influential paths and facilitates biological validation. BioPathNet leverages a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and uses stringent negative sampling to improve precision. In evaluations across various LP tasks, such as gene function annotation, drug-disease indication, synthetic lethality, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction prediction, BioPathNet consistently outperformed shallow node embedding methods, relational graph neural networks and task-specific state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robust performance and versatility. Our study predicts novel drug indications for diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Alzheimer's, validated by medical experts and clinical trials. We also identified new synthetic lethality gene pairs and regulatory interactions involving lncRNAs and target genes, confirmed through literature reviews. BioPathNet's interpretability will enable researchers to trace prediction paths and gain molecular insights, making it a valuable tool for drug discovery, personalized medicine and biology in general.",

  "title": "ChemMORT: an automatic ADMET optimization platform using deep learning and multi-objective particle swarm optimization",
  "abstract": "Drug discovery and development constitute a laborious and costly undertaking. The success of a drug hinges not only good efficacy but also acceptable absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Overall, up to 50% of drug development failures have been contributed from undesirable ADMET profiles. As a multiple parameter objective, the optimization of the ADMET properties is extremely challenging owing to the vast chemical space and limited human expert knowledge. In this study, a freely available platform called Chemical Molecular Optimization, Representation and Translation (ChemMORT) is developed for the optimization of multiple ADMET endpoints without the loss of potency (https://cadd.nscc-tj.cn/deploy/chemmort/). ChemMORT contains three modules: Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) Encoder, Descriptor Decoder and Molecular Optimizer. The SMILES Encoder can generate the molecular representation with a 512-dimensional vector, and the Descriptor Decoder is able to translate the above representation to the corresponding molecular structure with high accuracy. Based on reversible molecular representation and particle swarm optimization strategy, the Molecular Optimizer can be used to effectively optimize undesirable ADMET properties without the loss of bioactivity, which essentially accomplishes the design of inverse QSAR. The constrained multi-objective optimization of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibitor is provided as the case to explore the utility of ChemMORT.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET evaluation", "lead optimization", "substructure modification", "deep learning", "inverse QSAR", "reversible molecular representation", "particle swarm optimization"],
  "methods": "A sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model was trained based on SMILES notation for chemical space exploration. Three stacked Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers were used in both encoder and decoder networks. A fully connected layer with 512 units and hyperbolic tangent activation function generates 512-dimensional latent representation. The decoder uses beam search algorithm for sequence generation. An internal database with 1.7 million molecules was used, divided into training (1.53 million) and test (0.17 million) sets with 9:1 ratio. Every molecule was represented by 10 different enumerated SMILES strings. For ADMET prediction, around 30,000 entries covering logD7.4, LogS, Caco-2, MDCK cells, PPB, AMES toxicity, hERG toxicity, hepatoxicity and LD50 were collected from ChEMBL, EPA and DrugBank databases. Nine ADMET prediction models were constructed using 512-dimensional vectors and XGBoost algorithm. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was applied for multi-objective optimization with customized scoring scheme and structural constraints.",
  "results": "The neural translation model achieved 99.8% single character accuracy for both training and test sets, indicating high reliability. Nine ADMET prediction models showed strong performance: regression models averaged RMSE of 0.442 and R² of 0.747 for 5-fold cross validation, and 0.437 and 0.752 for test set respectively. Classification models averaged accuracy of 0.763 and AUC of 0.836 for cross validation, and 0.780 and 0.846 for test set. In the PARP-1 inhibitor optimization case study using Olaparib as initial molecule, 171 unique optimized molecules with higher bioactivity and better water-solubility were generated after 100 optimization cycles. The optimized molecules showed improved LogS values while maintaining structural similarity to Olaparib and preserving key binding interactions with PARP-1 target. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that optimized molecules maintained stable binding conformations and comparable binding free energies to the original compound.",
  "conclusions": "ChemMORT successfully demonstrates the ability to optimize multiple ADMET properties while preserving bioactivity through the integration of neural machine translation, credible ADMET prediction models, and multi-objective particle swarm optimization. The platform provides representation, translation and optimization functions through three modules: SMILES Encoder, Descriptor Decoder and Molecular Optimizer. The constrained multi-objective optimization of PARP-1 inhibitors validated the utility of ChemMORT in matching chemist design intuition while successfully optimizing ADMET properties. The platform accomplishes inverse QSAR design and offers a promising solution for the challenging multi-parameter optimization problem in drug discovery.",

  "title": "Topology-enhanced molecular graph representation for anti-breast cancer drug selection",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer is currently one of the cancers with a higher mortality rate in the world. The biological research on anti-breast cancer drugs focuses on the activity of estrogen receptors alpha (ERα), the pharmacokinetic properties and the safety of the compounds, which, however, is an expensive and time-consuming process. Developments of deep learning bring potential to efficiently facilitate the candidate drug selection against breast cancer. In this paper, we propose an Anti-Breast Cancer Drug selection method utilizing Gated Graph Neural Networks (ABCD-GGNN) to topologically enhance the molecular representation of candidate drugs. By constructing atom-level graphs through atomic descriptors for each distinct compound, ABCD-GGNN can topologically learn both the implicit structure and substructure characteristics of a candidate drug and then integrate the representation with explicit discrete molecular descriptors to generate a molecule-level representation. As a result, the representation of ABCD-GGNN can inductively predict the ERα, the pharmacokinetic properties and the safety of each candidate drug. Finally, we design a ranking operator whose inputs are the predicted properties so as to statistically select the appropriate drugs against breast cancer. Extensive experiments conducted on our collected anti-breast cancer candidate drug dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperform all the other representative methods in the tasks of predicting ERα, and the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of the compounds.",
  "keywords": ["Graph neural network", "Breast cancer", "Molecular representation", "Drug prediction", "Bioinformatics", "Deep learning", "Feature engineering", "Decision support system"],
  "methods": "We propose an Anti-Breast Cancer Drug selection method utilizing Gated Graph Neural Networks (ABCD-GGNN) to topologically enhance the molecular representation of candidate drugs. The method consists of four stages: 1) topological molecular graph representation based on GGNN which integrates both structure and substructure characteristics of the molecule, 2) discrete property representation based on machine learning algorithm, 3) integration of the molecular representation of ABCD-GGNN and prediction for ERα and ADMET, and 4) candidate drug selection based on our designed ranking operator. For atom-level graph construction, we summarize 8 atomic descriptors from the corresponding SMILES and 729 molecular descriptors, which are atom type, number of bonds, formal charge, chirality, hydrogen bound number, hybridization, aromaticity, and atom mass. We employ GGNN to realize the global information interaction between the atom nodes through neural networks with gated recurrent units (GRU). We additionally extract the substructures from SMILES of the molecules via the SMILES pair encoding algorithm and adopt an attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights of the original graph and each subgraph. For discrete molecular descriptor representation, we employ XGBoost algorithm to select the descriptors that count more, then reduce the dimensionality of the integrated molecular descriptor representation. We treat the prediction of ERα value and ADMET properties as a regression task and a two-class classification task, respectively.",
  "results": "Extensive experiments conducted on our collected anti-breast cancer candidate drug dataset demonstrate that our proposed ABCD-GGNN outperforms all the other representative methods in the tasks of predicting ERα, and the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of the compounds. In the ERα prediction task, ABCD-GGNN achieves the lowest loss value (MSE=0.4811) and highest R2 value (0.7741) compared to Linear Regression (MSE=2.156, R2=0.276), Random Forest (MSE=0.5147, R2=0.6133), and SVM (MSE=0.6878, R2=0.6273). In the ADMET prediction task, ABCD-GGNN achieves the highest performance on Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, and AUPR across all five properties (MN, HOB, hERG, CYP3A4, Caco-2), with precision values ranging from 0.8637 to 0.9474, significantly outperforming SVM, BiLSTM, and Graph-CNN baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that both representation readouts contribute to the final representation and are complementary to each other. The optimal hyper parameter λ is set as 0.6, and the optimal interaction step is set as 2. The ranking operator can make reasonable quantitative assessment of the compound's anti-breast cancer ability based on the classification prediction results.",
  "conclusions": "In this paper, we propose the ABCD-GGNN representation method aiming at topologically representing the features of anti-breast cancer candidate drugs and predicting the ERα value and ADMET properties of the organic compounds. Our proposed ABCD-GGNN representation method topologically learns both the implicit structure and substructure characteristics of a candidate drug and then deeply integrate them with explicit discrete molecular descriptors to strongly enhance the molecule-level representation. Extensive experiments conducted on our collected anti-breast cancer candidate drug dataset demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms all the other representative methods. Extended analysis also proves the biological rationality of our designed anti-breast cancer candidate drug selection strategy. Given the universality and adaptability of molecular representation methods, it is expectable that such framework, with corresponding modification, can also be utilized for the research on other drug selection and contribute to intelligent administration in the pharmacology community.",

Cycle 3: 战略设计 → "如何构建可持续的研究生态？"
Current: 实施科学 → "如何将理论框架转化为可操作的现实？"
```

### 1.2 复杂性理论视角下的问题重构

The oncoprotein MDM2 negatively regulates the tumor suppressor p53, and its overexpression in BC promotes tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents a promising therapeutic approach.

  "title": "Transfer learning enhanced graph neural network for aldehyde oxidase metabolism prediction and its experimental application",
  "abstract": "Aldehyde oxidase (AOX) is a molybdoenzyme that is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. AOX-mediated metabolism can result in unexpected outcomes, such as the production of toxic metabolites and high metabolic clearance, which can lead to the clinical failure of novel therapeutic agents. Computational models can assist medicinal chemists in rapidly evaluating the AOX metabolic risk of compounds during the early phases of drug discovery and provide valuable clues for manipulating AOX-mediated metabolism liability. In this study, we developed a novel graph neural network called AOMP for predicting AOX-mediated metabolism. AOMP integrated the tasks of metabolic substrate/non-substrate classification and metabolic site prediction, while utilizing transfer learning from 13C nuclear magnetic resonance data to enhance its performance on both tasks. AOMP significantly outperformed the benchmark methods in both cross-validation and external testing. Using AOMP, we systematically assessed the AOX-mediated metabolism of common fragments in kinase inhibitors and successfully identified four new scaffolds with AOX metabolism liability, which were validated through in vitro experiments. Furthermore, for the convenience of the community, we established the first online service for AOX metabolism prediction based on AOMP, which is freely available at https://aomp.alphama.com.cn.",
  "keywords": ["Drug metabolism", "Aldehyde oxidase", "Transfer learning", "Graph neural network", "Kinase inhibitor"],
  "methods": "AOMP is a variant of Attentive FP with seven GNN layers. The first six layers perform message passing between neighbor atoms (Stage 1) to learn local atomic information, while the last layer performs message passing between all atoms in the molecule (Stage 2) to capture distant atomic interactions. The model uses 2D molecular topological graphs as input with eight atom features and four bond features. A transfer learning strategy was adopted where the model was first pre-trained with 13C-NMR chemical shift data from 25,000 molecules obtained from nmrshiftdb2, then fine-tuned on AOX metabolism data. The training set consisted of 203 substrates and 296 non-substrates with 324 SOMs and 755 non-SOMs. The model unifies substrate/non-substrate classification and SOM prediction tasks using a mixed loss function combining both molecular-level and atomic-level classification losses.",
  "results": "AOMP achieved superior performance with AUC of 0.909 for substrate/non-substrate classification and 0.918 for SOM/non-SOM classification in cross-validation. On external testing, AOMP achieved AUC of 0.881 for substrate classification and 0.892 for SOM prediction, significantly outperforming baseline methods including KNN, SVM, RF, ANN, and Attentive FP. The transfer learning strategy improved performance substantially - AOMP without pretraining achieved lower AUCs of 0.854 and 0.789 respectively. Systematic evaluation of 132 heterocyclic cores in kinase inhibitors identified 23 high-risk fragments, with experimental validation confirming four new AOX metabolic-sensitive scaffolds. The model correctly predicted AOX metabolism liability for 25 out of 27 molecules in external validation, with the three misclassified molecules showing very weak metabolic activity.",
  "conclusions": "AOMP represents a novel paradigm for AOX metabolism prediction by unifying atomic-level and molecular-level classification tasks and utilizing NMR shift data for transfer learning. The model enables large-scale screening without requiring computationally expensive quantum chemical calculations. The discovery of four novel N-heterocycles prone to AOX metabolism expands understanding of chemical motifs with high AOX susceptibility and provides guidance for kinase inhibitor design. The freely available web service at https://aomp.alphama.com.cn serves the community for accurate, fast, and convenient AOX metabolism prediction. This work demonstrates the potential of NMR shift data in enhancing neural networks' understanding of molecular properties and points toward a promising direction for molecular representation learning.",

  "title": "Prediction and Screening Model for Products Based on Fusion Regression and XGBoost Classification",
  "abstract": "Performance prediction based on candidates and screening based on predicted performance value are the core of product development. For example, the performance prediction and screening of equipment components and parts are an important guarantee for the reliability of equipment products. The prediction and screening of drug bioactivity value and performance are the keys to pharmaceutical product development. The main reasons for the failure of pharmaceutical discovery are the low bioactivity of the candidate compounds and the deficiencies in their efficacy and safety, which are related to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of the compounds. Therefore, it is very necessary to quickly and effectively perform systematic bioactivity value prediction and ADMET property evaluation for candidate compounds in the early stage of drug discovery. In this paper, a data-driven pharmaceutical products screening prediction model is proposed to screen drug candidates with higher bioactivity value and better ADMET properties. First, a quantitative prediction method for bioactivity value is proposed using the fusion regression of LGBM and neural network based on backpropagation (BP-NN). Then, the ADMET properties prediction method is proposed using XGBoost. According to the predicted bioactivity value and ADMET properties, the BVAP method is defined to screen the drug candidates. And the screening model is validated on the dataset of antagonized Erα active compounds, in which the mean square error (MSE) of fusion regression is 1.1496, the XGBoost prediction accuracy of ADMET properties are 94.0% for Caco-2, 95.7% for CYP3A4, 89.4% for HERG, 88.6% for hob, and 96.2% for Mn. Compared with the commonly used methods for ADMET properties such as SVM, RF, KNN, LDA, and NB, the XGBoost in this paper has the highest prediction accuracy and AUC value, which has better guiding significance and can help screen pharmaceutical product candidates with good bioactivity, pharmacokinetic properties, and safety.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET prediction", "machine learning", "XGBoost", "fusion regression", "drug screening", "bioactivity prediction", "pharmaceutical products"],
  "methods": "The pharmaceutical products screening model is divided into four parts. First, data preprocessing is performed according to preprocessing rules to remove low-information variables or redundant variables. If the relative variance of a molecular descriptor is less than σ, delete the molecular descriptor. If the correlation coefficient of a pair of molecular descriptors is greater than C, delete any one of the molecular descriptors. For quantitative prediction, fusion regression assembles the LGBM and BP-NN to make the quantitative prediction. The LGBM is used to extract the further features related to the bioactivity value and also reduce the dimension of the BP-NN input layer, thereby reducing the complexity of its training. The BP-NN uses the extracted features to predict the bioactivity value. For ADMET properties prediction, XGBoost is used as an integrated machine learning algorithm based on decision trees, using a gradient ascent framework, suitable for classification and regression problems. XGBoost introduces regularization in the loss function to establish the objective function: J(θ) = L(θ) + Ω(θ), where L(θ) is a differentiable convex loss function and Ω(θ) is a regularization term. Based on the predicted bioactivity value and ADMET properties, the BVAP method is defined to screen drug candidates using weight calculation: BVAP = αBV + βAP, where α is the weight of BV (bioactivity value) and β is the weight of AP (ADMET properties).",
  "results": "The validation was performed on the dataset of compounds that antagonize the activity of Erα, containing 729 molecular descriptors of 1,974 compounds. After data preprocessing, 361 molecular descriptors remained, which were further reduced to 123 after correlation analysis. LGBM was used to screen the top 20 molecular descriptors with higher importance degrees. The BP-NN method consists of 1 input layer, 2 fully connected layers, and 1 output layer, with input dimension set to 20, hidden layer dimensions set to 300, and output dimension set to 1. The MSE of fusion regression is 1.1496. For ADMET properties prediction using XGBoost, the prediction accuracies are: Caco-2: 94.0%, CYP3A4: 95.7%, hERG: 89.4%, HOB: 88.6%, and MN: 96.2%. The AUC values are: Caco-2: 0.933, CYP3A4: 0.954, hERG: 0.891, HOB: 0.839, and MN: 0.939. Compared with other methods (SVM, RF, KNN, LDA, and NB), XGBoost achieved the highest prediction accuracy and AUC values across all ADMET properties. The screening model successfully identified the top 10 drug candidates with better bioactivity values and ADMET properties using the BVAP method.",
  "conclusions": "This paper proposes a screening model for pharmaceutical products candidates with better bioactivity value and ADMET properties and validates it on the data set of compounds that antagonize the activity of Erα. The fusion regression using LGBM for further feature extraction and BP-NN method for bioactivity value prediction achieved an MSE of 1.1496. The XGBoost method for ADMET properties prediction demonstrated superior performance compared to other commonly used methods, with prediction accuracies ranging from 88.6% to 96.2% and AUC values from 0.839 to 0.954. The BVAP method successfully screens drug candidates with better bioactivity value and ADMET properties. The prediction and screening model proposed has better comprehensive performance and can provide prediction services for bioactivity value and ADMET properties, which is beneficial to improving the prediction and screening model for drug candidates and can help screen pharmaceutical product candidates with good bioactivity, pharmacokinetic properties, and safety.",

  "title": "MetaboGNN: predicting liver metabolic stability with graph neural networks and cross-species data",
  "abstract": "The metabolic stability of a drug is a crucial determinant of its pharmacokinetic properties, including clearance, half-life, and oral bioavailability. Accurate predictions of metabolic stability can significantly streamline the drug discovery process. In this study, we present MetaboGNN, an advanced model for predicting liver metabolic stability based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). Using a high-quality dataset from the 2023 South Korea Data Challenge for Drug Discovery, which comprises 3,498 training molecules and 483 test molecules, we presented molecular structures as graphs to capture the intricate structural relationships that influence metabolic stability. A GCL-driven pretraining step was employed to enhance model generalizability by learning robust, transferable graph-level representations. Notably, incorporating interspecies differences between human liver microsomes (HLM) and mouse liver microsomes (MLM) further improved predictive accuracy, achieving Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 27.91 (HLM) and 27.86 (MLM), both expressed as the percentage of parent compound remaining after a 30-min incubation. Compared to traditional approaches, MetaboGNN demonstrates superior predictive performance and highlights the importance of considering interspecies enzymatic variations. In addition, attention-based analysis identified key molecular fragments associated with metabolic stability, highlighting chemically meaningful structural determinants. These findings establish MetaboGNN as a powerful tool for metabolic stability prediction, supporting more efficient lead optimization processes in drug discovery.",
  "keywords": ["Drug metabolism", "Liver microsomal stability", "Graph neural networks", "Graph contrastive learning", "Interspecies differences"],
  "methods": "Using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture, we represent molecules as graphs where atoms are nodes, bonds are edges, and ring structures are explicitly included to capture critical structural features. Each atom is featurized by its type, hybridization state, aromaticity, and formal charge, while bonds are described by their types (single, double, triple, or aromatic) and conjugation states. The training process consists of two stages. In the first stage, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) was applied as a pretraining method using a large-scale unlabeled molecular dataset containing over 2.58 million molecules. Our pretraining dataset comprised approximately 2,000,000 drug-like compounds from ZINC and various subsets from MoleculeNet. We employed an attribute masking strategy that occludes a subset of node and edge features, such as partial charge, aromaticity, or hybridization state, while preserving the structural topology of the molecular graph. In the second stage, task-specific fine-tuning was performed to predict liver microsomal stability for both human (HLM) and mouse (MLM) systems. A multi-task learning framework was employed to incorporate interspecies differences as a dedicated task, allowing the model to learn both HLM–MLM differences and individual metabolic stability values simultaneously.",
  "results": "MetaboGNN with GCL achieved the lowest RMSE for both human and mouse data, with RMSE values of 30.14 (95% CI 29.89–30.39) and 28.72 (95% CI 28.55–28.88), respectively, representing the best overall performance among all models evaluated. Incorporating interspecies differences to the MetaboGNN (GCL) model reduced the RMSE from 30.14 to 27.91 for the human dataset and from 28.72 to 27.86 for the mouse dataset, achieving the best overall performance. The performance gains were consistent across different deep learning architectures, including both graph-based and language-based models. Compounds with larger |HLM − MLM| differences exhibited greater improvements in predictive performance, and the effect was more pronounced in groups with favorable drug-like properties, such as better permeability and solubility. For binary classification, our model achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.4781, which is significantly higher than MS-BACL (0.4155) and PredMS (0.3425).",
  "conclusions": "We developed MetaboGNN, a novel predictive framework for liver metabolic stability based on GNNs and GCL. Our findings demonstrate that GNN-based models can effectively capture both structural features and their relationship with metabolic stability, while GCL enhances representation learning from unlabeled data and improves the model's generalizability. By explicitly incorporating interspecies differences between human and mouse liver microsomes into model training, MetaboGNN showed significant performance improvements, especially for compounds with larger metabolic discrepancies between species. Our model's ability to account for both molecular structure and interspecies metabolic differences represents a major advancement in predicting metabolic stability. MetaboGNN can support the prediction of pharmacokinetic properties in lead optimization, offering potential applications in drug discovery and development.",

Tool #1: think
I'll analyze this thought deeply and provide structured insights about the literature relevance assessment for ADMET prediction research.
Tool #2: current_time
## Deep Analysis of Literature Relevance Assessment

### 1. Core Problem Identification

The thought reveals a critical challenge in literature review methodology: **distinguishing between tool application and tool development** in ADMET prediction research. This is a fundamental issue that affects the quality and focus of systematic reviews.

### 2. Structured Analysis Framework

#### A. Relevance Assessment Criteria
The analysis demonstrates a sophisticated multi-dimensional evaluation approach:

- **Temporal Relevance**: ✓ Meets 5-year criterion (2023)
- **Topical Relevance**: ⚠️ Partial - includes ADMET but as secondary focus
- **Methodological Relevance**: ⚠️ Limited - uses existing tools rather than developing new ones
- **Innovation Relevance**: ✗ Low for tool development research
- **Research Focus Alignment**: ✗ Primary focus on drug discovery, not ADMET methodology

#### B. Literature Classification Framework
This case illustrates the need for clear categorization:

1. **Primary ADMET Research**: Develops new prediction methods/algorithms
2. **Applied ADMET Research**: Uses existing tools for specific applications
3. **Hybrid ADMET Research**: Combines application with methodological improvements

### 3. Key Insights and Implications

#### Critical Insight 1: Research Purpose Hierarchy
The literature serves drug discovery (primary) using ADMET tools (secondary), not advancing ADMET methodology itself. This hierarchical relationship is crucial for relevance assessment.

#### Critical Insight 2: Tool vs. Application Distinction
- **Tool Development**: Creates/improves ADMET prediction capabilities
- **Tool Application**: Applies existing ADMET tools to solve domain-specific problems
- **Research Value**: Different for methodology vs. application-focused reviews

#### Critical Insight 3: Context-Dependent Relevance
The same paper could be highly relevant for COVID-19 drug discovery research but only marginally relevant for ADMET tool development research.

### 4. Methodological Connections

This analysis connects to several important research methodology concepts:

- **Systematic Review Protocols**: Need for precise inclusion/exclusion criteria
- **Literature Taxonomy**: Importance of classifying papers by research contribution type
- **Bias Prevention**: Avoiding inclusion of tangentially related work that dilutes focus
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluating papers based on their contribution to the specific research question

### 5. Actionable Conclusions

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Develop Clear Inclusion Criteria**: Specify whether the review focuses on tool development, application, or both
2. **Create Classification Schema**: Establish categories for different types of ADMET research
3. **Implement Relevance Scoring**: Use multi-dimensional scoring for borderline cases

#### Strategic Recommendations:
1. **Refine Search Strategy**: Add keywords that specifically target methodological development
2. **Establish Review Boundaries**: Clearly define what constitutes "ADMET prediction tool research"
3. **Consider Separate Categories**: Potentially separate reviews for tool development vs. applications

#### Quality Assurance Measures:
1. **Dual Review Process**: Have multiple reviewers assess relevance independently
2. **Relevance Calibration**: Use pilot studies to align reviewer understanding
3. **Documentation Standards**: Record detailed rationale for inclusion/exclusion decisions

### 6. Broader Research Implications

This analysis reveals important considerations for computational research reviews:

- **Interdisciplinary Challenges**: ADMET research spans multiple domains, requiring careful boundary setting
- **Rapid Field Evolution**: Need to distinguish between established and emerging methodologies
- **Practical vs. Theoretical Contributions**: Different value propositions for different research goals

### 7. Meta-Analysis Considerations

The thought process demonstrates sophisticated analytical thinking that could inform:
- Development of automated relevance assessment tools
- Training materials for literature review methodologies
- Standards for computational chemistry systematic reviews

This case study exemplifies the complexity of modern literature analysis and the need for rigorous, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks in rapidly evolving computational fields.
Tool #3: current_time
# Advanced Analysis: Literature Relevance Assessment in Computational Research (Cycle 2/3)

## Deep Analytical Processing

### 1. Emergent Patterns and Meta-Insights

The previous analysis reveals a **fundamental epistemological tension** in computational research literature assessment: the boundary between **methodological innovation** and **methodological application** is increasingly blurred in modern interdisciplinary research.

#### Pattern Recognition:
- **Convergence Phenomenon**: Traditional boundaries between tool development and application are dissolving
- **Methodological Hybridization**: Modern papers increasingly combine application with incremental methodological improvements
- **Context-Dependent Value**: The same research artifact has different relevance values across different research contexts

### 2. Advanced Theoretical Framework Development

#### A. Multi-Dimensional Relevance Tensor Model

Building on the previous framework, I propose a **Relevance Tensor Model** with three primary dimensions:

1. **Methodological Contribution Axis** (M): 0-1 scale
   - 0.0-0.3: Pure application
   - 0.3-0.7: Hybrid contribution
   - 0.7-1.0: Pure methodological innovation

2. **Domain Specificity Axis** (D): 0-1 scale
   - 0.0-0.3: Highly domain-specific
   - 0.3-0.7: Cross-domain applicable
   - 0.7-1.0: Domain-agnostic methodology

3. **Temporal Innovation Axis** (T): 0-1 scale
   - 0.0-0.3: Incremental improvement
   - 0.3-0.7: Significant advancement
   - 0.7-1.0: Paradigm-shifting innovation

**Relevance Score = f(M, D, T, Context_Weight_Vector)**

#### B. Dynamic Relevance Assessment Protocol

```
IF (M > 0.7 AND D > 0.5) THEN Primary_Relevance = HIGH
ELIF (M > 0.5 AND T > 0.6) THEN Primary_Relevance = MODERATE-HIGH
ELIF (M < 0.3 AND D < 0.5) THEN Primary_Relevance = LOW
ELSE Secondary_Assessment_Required = TRUE
```

### 3. Strategic Implications for Research Methodology

#### Critical Insight 4: The Granularity Problem
Modern computational research operates at multiple granularity levels simultaneously:
- **Macro-level**: Overall research paradigms (ML vs. physics-based)
- **Meso-level**: Specific algorithmic approaches (deep learning architectures)
- **Micro-level**: Implementation details and optimizations

**Implication**: Literature reviews must specify their target granularity level to maintain coherence.

#### Critical Insight 5: The Temporal Decay Function
Research relevance follows a complex temporal decay pattern:
- **Immediate Impact**: High relevance for current applications
- **Methodological Legacy**: Sustained relevance for foundational contributions
- **Historical Context**: Renewed relevance as fields mature and require historical perspective

### 4. Advanced Methodological Connections

#### Connection to Information Theory
The relevance assessment problem can be framed as an **information filtering challenge**:
- **Signal**: Methodologically relevant contributions
- **Noise**: Application-focused work without methodological innovation
- **Channel**: Literature databases and search mechanisms
- **Decoder**: Human expert assessment + automated filtering

#### Connection to Network Theory
Literature forms a **citation network** where relevance propagates through:
- **Direct Citations**: Explicit methodological building
- **Indirect Influence**: Conceptual framework adoption
- **Cluster Formation**: Research communities around specific approaches

### 5. Predictive Framework Development

#### Anticipating Future Challenges

Based on current trends, I predict three emerging challenges:

1. **AI-Generated Literature Explosion**: Automated paper generation will require new authenticity and relevance filters
2. **Cross-Domain Methodology Transfer**: Increasing need to assess relevance across traditionally separate fields
3. **Real-Time Relevance Assessment**: Dynamic updating of relevance scores as fields evolve rapidly

#### Proactive Solutions Framework

1. **Adaptive Inclusion Criteria**: Self-updating criteria based on field evolution
2. **Semantic Relevance Mapping**: AI-assisted understanding of conceptual relationships
3. **Community-Driven Validation**: Crowdsourced relevance assessment from domain experts

### 6. Implementation Strategy for Advanced Literature Analysis

#### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-3)
- Develop standardized relevance assessment protocols
- Create training datasets for automated relevance scoring
- Establish inter-rater reliability benchmarks

#### Phase 2: Tool Development (Months 4-8)
- Build AI-assisted relevance assessment tools
- Implement dynamic literature monitoring systems
- Create visualization tools for relevance landscapes

#### Phase 3: Community Integration (Months 9-12)
- Deploy community validation platforms
- Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Create educational resources for best practices

### 7. Philosophical Implications

#### The Hermeneutic Circle in Literature Assessment
The process of determining relevance is inherently circular:
- We need to understand the field to assess relevance
- We need relevant literature to understand the field
- This creates an interpretive spiral requiring iterative refinement

#### Objectivity vs. Subjectivity Tension
While we strive for objective relevance criteria, the assessment process is inherently subjective, influenced by:
- Reviewer expertise and background
- Current research trends and fashions
- Institutional and funding priorities

### 8. Next-Level Research Questions

1. **Can machine learning models be trained to assess literature relevance with expert-level accuracy?**
2. **How do relevance patterns differ across computational research domains?**
3. **What is the optimal balance between precision and recall in literature filtering?**
4. **How can we account for cultural and linguistic biases in relevance assessment?**

### 9. Synthesis and Forward Momentum

This analysis reveals that literature relevance assessment is not merely a technical challenge but a **fundamental epistemological problem** in computational research. The solution requires:

- **Technical Innovation**: Advanced filtering and assessment tools
- **Methodological Rigor**: Standardized protocols and validation procedures
- **Community Engagement**: Collaborative approaches to knowledge validation
- **Philosophical Clarity**: Clear understanding of what constitutes relevant knowledge

The path forward involves creating **adaptive, community-driven, AI-assisted systems** that can evolve with the rapidly changing landscape of computational research while maintaining the rigor necessary for high-quality systematic reviews.

Tool #4: current_time
# Synthesis and Implementation: Literature Relevance Assessment Framework (Final Cycle 3/3)

## Deep Analytical Processing - Final Integration

### 1. Meta-Cognitive Reflection on the Analytical Journey

The three-cycle analysis has revealed a **paradigmatic shift** in how we conceptualize literature relevance assessment. We've moved from:
- **Linear thinking** → **Systems thinking**
- **Binary classification** → **Multidimensional assessment**
- **Static criteria** → **Dynamic, adaptive frameworks**

This evolution mirrors the broader transformation in computational research itself, where rigid disciplinary boundaries are dissolving into fluid, interconnected knowledge networks.

### 2. Unified Theoretical Framework: The Relevance Ecosystem Model

  "title": "A Computational Study on Selected Alkaloids as SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors: PASS Prediction, Molecular Docking, ADMET Analysis, DFT, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations",
  "abstract": "Despite treatments and vaccinations, it remains difficult to develop naturally occurring COVID-19 inhibitors. Here, our main objective is to find potential lead compounds from the retrieved alkaloids with antiviral and other biological properties that selectively target the main SARS-CoV-2 protease (Mpro), which is required for viral replication. In this work, 252 alkaloids were aligned using Lipinski's rule of five and their antiviral activity was then assessed. The prediction of activity spectrum of substances (PASS) data was used to confirm the antiviral activities of 112 alkaloids. Finally, 50 alkaloids were docked with Mpro. Furthermore, assessments of molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS), density functional theory (DFT), and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) were performed, and a few of them appeared to have potential as candidates for oral administration. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) with a time step of up to 100 ns were used to confirm that the three docked complexes were more stable. It was found that the most prevalent and active binding sites that limit Mpro's activity are PHE294, ARG298, and GLN110. All retrieved data were compared to conventional antivirals, fumarostelline, strychnidin-10-one (L-1), 2,3-dimethoxy-brucin (L-7), and alkaloid ND-305B (L-16) and were proposed as enhanced SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Finally, with additional clinical or necessary study, it may be able to use these indicated natural alkaloids or their analogs as potential therapeutic candidates.",
  "keywords": [],
  "methods": "The prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) was used to assess the biological activity of the chosen alkaloids. Pa and Pi values were used to forecast whether the ligands were possibly active or inactive. 256 alkaloids' antiviral capabilities were examined and 50 projected alkaloids with potential antiviral characteristics were taken into consideration. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein (PDB ID: 6M03) was downloaded from the PDB. Each alkaloid structure was downloaded in SDF format from the PubChem database and optimized using the functional B3LYP and basis set 6-31G of the Gaussian 16 program. SARS-CoV-2 of Mpro was the target molecule for docking with the selected ligands, and AutoDock Vina in PyRx, version 0.8, was used for the molecular docking investigation. The SwissADME server was used to analyze drug-likeness properties including Ghose, Veber, Egan, Muegge rules, and bioavailability. AdmetSAR and pkCSM servers were used to analyze absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET), solubility, carcinogenicity, and other pharmacokinetics. Density functional theory was used to determine the chemical stability by analyzing the electrical characteristics of the top 2 bioactive alkaloid ligands. The YASARA dynamics software program and the AMBER14 force field were used to conduct molecular dynamics simulation of the ligand-protein complexes for 100 ns.",
  "results": "The PASS online tool identified 102 compounds with Pa values of more than 0.3 with antiviral properties, from which the first 50 predicted antivirals were used for molecular docking studies. Fumarostelline and brucine had the highest docking scores, both at −8.5 kcal/mol (L-1 & L-7). Compared to other licensed antivirals (remdesivir −7.8 kcal/mol), molecules with higher binding energies may be better SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The most prevalent and active binding sites that limit Mpro's activity are PHE294, ARG298, and GLN110. Based on molecular analysis of the top ten docking score compounds, the number of hydrogen bond acceptors ranges from 3 to 7 and hydrogen bond donors ranges from 0 to 2, meeting Lipinski's rule requirements. All shortlisted compounds have topological polar surface area (TPSA) values between 21 and 88, and lipophilicity (XLOGP3) up to 3.39. Human intestinal absorption is greater than 94% for 9 out of 10 drugs. All of the alkaloids chosen precisely followed the LGVEM guidelines without breaking any of them. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that all three complexes remained stable across the entire simulation time with RMSD values not surpassing 2.5 Å.",
  "conclusions": "Based on computer-aided drug design, the highest possible docking score was −8.5 kcal/mol (L-7 and L-1). After comparing all outcomes to the FDA-approved antiviral drug remdesivir, the following compounds are suggested as improved SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory lead compounds: fumarostelline, strychnidin-10-one (L-1), 2,3-dimethoxy-brucin (L-7), and the alkaloid ND-305B (L-16). The formation of the PHE294, ARG298, and GLN110 residues by the proposed lead compounds may limit the function of the viral protein Mpro (6M03) to combat SARS-CoV-2. Suggested compounds can be used for further in vitro and in vivo studies.",

  "title": "GraphADT: empowering interpretable predictions of acute dermal toxicity with multi-view graph pooling and structure remapping",
  "abstract": "Accurate prediction of acute dermal toxicity (ADT) is essential for the safe and effective development of contact drugs. Currently, graph neural networks, a form of deep learning technology, accurately model the structure of compound molecules, enhancing predictions of their ADT. However, many existing methods emphasize atom-level information transfer and overlook crucial data conveyed by molecular bonds and their interrelationships. Additionally, these methods often generate \"equal\" node representations across the entire graph, failing to accentuate \"important\" substructures like functional groups, pharmacophores, and toxicophores, thereby reducing interpretability. We introduce a novel model, GraphADT, utilizing structure remapping and multi-view graph pooling (MVPool) technologies to accurately predict compound ADT. Initially, our model applies structure remapping to better delineate bonds, transforming \"bonds\" into new nodes and \"bond-atom-bond\" interactions into new edges, thereby reconstructing the compound molecular graph. Subsequently, we use MVPool to amalgamate data from various perspectives, minimizing biases inherent to single-view analyses. Following this, the model generates a robust node ranking collaboratively, emphasizing critical nodes or substructures to enhance model interpretability. Lastly, we apply a graph comparison learning strategy to train both the original and structure remapped molecular graphs, deriving the final molecular representation. Experimental results on public datasets indicate that the GraphADT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.",

(2) Multi-view graph pooling (MVPool) generates three node importance rankings based on topology and features: node structure view using degree centrality, node feature view using multilayer perceptron, and node structure-feature view using advanced PageRank method. An adaptive attention mechanism learns weights for each ranking and integrates them to identify \"important\" nodes.

  "title": "FP-ADMET: a compendium of fingerprint-based ADMET prediction models",
  "abstract": "The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of drugs plays a key role in determining which among the potential candidates are to be prioritized. In silico approaches based on machine learning methods are becoming increasing popular, but are nonetheless limited by the availability of data. With a view to making both data and models available to the scientific community, we have developed FPADMET which is a repository of molecular fingerprint-based predictive models for ADMET properties. In this article, we have examined the efficacy of fingerprint-based machine learning models for a large number of ADMET-related properties. The predictive ability of a set of 20 different binary fingerprints (based on substructure keys, atom pairs, local path environments, as well as custom fingerprints such as all-shortest paths) for over 50 ADMET and ADMET-related endpoints have been evaluated as part of the study. We find that for a majority of the properties, fingerprint-based random forest models yield comparable or better performance compared with traditional 2D/3D molecular descriptors.",
  "keywords": ["ADMET", "Machine learning", "Molecular fingerprints"],
  "methods": "In this study, we have examined 20 different fingerprints that are routinely used as similarity search tools in drug discovery. The ECFP- and FCFP-class fingerprints are circular topological fingerprints, MACCS and PUBCHEM fingerprints are substructure fingerprints, and other fingerprints include path based fingerprints such as depth-first search fingerprints (DFS), all-shortest path encoding (ASP), radial fingerprints (Molprint2D), topological atom pairs (AP2D) and triplets (AT2D). Fingerprint calculations were performed using in-house code written in Java and makes use of the Chemistry Development Kit library. Data for different endpoints were collected from previously published articles and databases with a primary source being the Online Chemical Database (OCHEM). The Random Forest algorithm was chosen to build the models, which is an ensemble learning method for both classification and regression. The models were trained using the ranger library in R. The number of trees was set to 500. For each endpoint, the data was split randomly into separate training (80%) and test (20%) sets. A fivefold cross-validation was used to identify the best performing model.",
  "results": "For the various endpoints, high classification accuracies (BACC>0.80) are obtained for the blood brain barrier permeability, plasma protein binding, CYP450 inhibition (3A4/2C19/1A2/2C9/2C8 isoforms), human intestinal absorption, breast cancer resistance protein inhibition, p-glycoprotein inhibitor/substrate and hemolytic/respiratory toxicity. For some endpoints such as mitochondrial/urinary tract toxicity, human liver microsomal stability, metabolic intrinsic clearance, AMES mutagenecity, cytotoxicity (multiple cell lines), hERG cardiotoxicity/liability, drug induced liver injury, myelotoxicity, phospholipidosis, rhabdomyolysis, OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibition, BSEP and OCT2 inhibition, moderate (BACC=0.71to-0.78) performances were observed. In the case of regression models, performances were largely on the poorer side with the exception of pKa, log S, log D, human serum albumin and skin penetration, Rcv2>0.70. While the pharmacaphore fingerprints perform poorly on all datasets, fingerprints based on substructure keys (PUBCHEM, MACCS, KR) show moderate to high accuracies for a majority of the modelled endpoints.",
  "conclusions": "The results show that the machine learning performance using the different fingerprint encodings rival those of traditional descriptor-based methods. Future work will focus on combining different data sets in a multitask modeling approach which has been shown to yield statistically superior results compared with single-task models. In order to facilitate ADMET evaluation, the best performing models have been compiled into an open access software package called FPADMET that can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/vishsoft/fpadmet.",

  "title": "Multi-fidelity graph neural networks for predicting toluene/water partition coefficients",
  "abstract": "Accurate prediction of toluene/water partition coefficients of neutral species is crucial in drug discovery and separation processes; however, data-driven modeling of these coefficients remains challenging due to limited available experimental data. To address the limitation of available data, we apply multi-fidelity learning approaches leveraging a quantum chemical dataset (low fidelity) of approximately 9000 entries generated by COSMO-RS and an experimental dataset (high fidelity) of about 250 entries collected from the literature. We explore the transfer learning, feature-augmented learning, and multi-target learning approaches in combination with graph neural networks, validating them on two external datasets: one with molecules similar to training data (EXT-Zamora) and one with more challenging molecules (EXT-SAMPL9). Our results show that multi-target learning significantly improves predictive accuracy, achieving a root-mean-square error of 0.44 logP units for the EXT-Zamora, compared to a root-mean-square error of 0.63 logP units for single-task models. For the EXT-SAMPL9 dataset, multi-target learning achieves a root-mean-square error of 1.02 logP units, indicating reasonable performance even for more complex molecular structures. These findings highlight the potential of multi-fidelity learning approaches that leverage quantum chemical data to improve toluene/water partition coefficient predictions and address challenges posed by limited experimental data.",
  "keywords": ["Graph neural network", "Multi-fidelity learning", "Partition coefficients"],
  "methods": "We apply various ML models and multi-fidelity learning approaches to predict the toluene/water logP of neutral species. Initially, we generate a low fidelity QC dataset consisting of approximately 9000 toluene/water logP values using the COSMO-RS approach. We use this dataset to pretrain GNN models, then fine-tune and test the pretrained GNN models with different multi-fidelity learning approaches using high fidelity datasets. We utilize three multi-fidelity approaches: transfer learning (leverages pretrained models on LF-QC dataset to fine-tune predictions on the HF-Exp dataset), feature-augmented learning (combines datasets by first training on LF-QC then using predictions as additional features for training on HF-Exp), and multi-target learning (simultaneously predicts both experimental and synthetic properties using a single model). We use the Directed-Message Passing Neural Network (D-MPNN) model implemented in chemprop v1.7, with datasets split into 80-10-10 training-validation-test proportions using random splitting. Model hyperparameters are tuned using 100 iterations of Bayesian optimization.",
  "results": "Multi-target learning significantly improves predictive accuracy over single-task models. For the EXT-Zamora dataset, multi-target learning achieves RMSE of 0.44 logP units and R² of 0.93, compared to single-task models with RMSE of 0.63 logP units and R² of 0.86. For the EXT-SAMPL9 dataset, multi-target learning achieves RMSE of 1.02 logP units and R² of 0.79, compared to single-task models with RMSE of 1.32 logP units and R² of 0.65. Transfer learning shows improvement with RMSE of 0.51 logP units (EXT-Zamora) and 1.14 logP units (EXT-SAMPL9). Feature-augmented learning performs less effectively with RMSE of 0.81 logP units (EXT-Zamora) and 1.16 logP units (EXT-SAMPL9). Multi-target learning demonstrates the most consistent performance across different molecular weights and chemical classes, showing particularly strong results for light molecules and maintaining robustness across various chemical structures including phenols, ketones, and aromatic compounds.",
  "conclusions": "Multi-target learning, i.e., predicting low fidelity and high fidelity target properties with one GNN model, yields substantial accuracy increases compared to training a GNN model on experimental data only and is superior to transfer learning and feature-augmented learning. The multi-target learning approach presumably requires the least training and model changes, i.e., just an additional model output, and is thus straightforward to implement. Generating additional molecular property data through QC calculations for training predictive ML models like GNN models is highly promising to enhance the predictive quality when available experimental data is limited. However, the availability of high fidelity data remains a significant challenge and the extrapolation to new chemical classes cannot be fully resolved with multi-fidelity learning approaches leveraging large low-fidelity datasets. Future work could consider multi-target learning with low and high fidelity datasets for multiple molecular properties, combining activity coefficients, solvation free energies, and partition coefficients.",

  "title": "Virtual Prospection of Marine Cyclopeptides as Therapeutics by Means of Conceptual DFT and Computational ADMET",
  "abstract": "Bioactive peptides are chemical compounds created through the covalent bonding of amino acids, known as amide or peptide bonds. Due to their unusual chemistry and various biological effects, marine bioactive peptides have garnered considerable research. The effectiveness of a bioactive marine peptide is attributed to its structural features, such as amino acid content and sequence, which vary depending on the degree of action. Cyclic peptides combine several favorable properties such as good binding affinity, target selectivity and low toxicity that render them an attractive modality for the development of therapeutics. The apratoxins are a class of molecules formed by a series of cyclic depsipeptides with potent cytotoxic activities. The objective of this research is to pursue a computational prospection of the molecular structures and properties of several cylopeptides of marine origin with potential therapeutic applications. The methodology will be based on the determination of the chemical reactivity descriptors of the studied molecules through the consideration of the Conceptual DFT model and validation of a particular model chemistry, MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O. These studies will be complemented by a determination of the pharmacokinetics and ADMET parameters by resorting to certain cheminformatics tools.",
  "keywords": ["apratoxins", "chemical reactivity theory", "conceptual DFT", "global and local reactivity descriptors", "pKa", "bioavailability", "bioactivity scores", "ADMET"],
  "methods": "The main approach is based on the application of Conceptual DFT for the prediction of chemical reactivity properties. Starting with calculation of fundamental molecular structures determining electronic densities and corresponding molecular and orbital energies, mainly HOMO and LUMO. Conformers were predicted using MarvinView 17.15 software with MMFF94 force field for Molecular Mechanics calculations. Each conformer underwent geometry optimization and frequency calculation using Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTBA) methodology. This was followed by geometry reoptimization, frequency analysis and calculation of electronic properties using MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O model chemistry within the Kohn–Sham approach. Gaussian 16 software and SMD solvation model were used. The methodology was validated using the 'Koopmans in DFT' (KID) procedure to verify fulfillment of Janak and Ionization Energy theorems. For ADMET studies, Chemicalize software from ChemAxon was used, with additional pharmacokinetic parameters obtained using admetSAR software for SMILES-based predictions. Molinspiration software computed molecular characteristics and bioactivity scores for pharmacological targets including enzymes, nuclear receptors, kinase inhibitors, GPCR ligands, and ion channel modulators.",
  "results": "The KID procedure validated the MN12SX/Def2TZVP/H2O model chemistry showing fulfillment of Janak and Ionization Energy theorems for all molecular systems. Apratoxin A exhibited the largest global hardness (HOMO-LUMO gap of 5.02 eV) making it the least reactive, while Apratoxin C was the most reactive (4.28 eV gap). Apratoxins B and G displayed the highest electronic chemical potentials. All peptides except Apratoxin A were classified as moderate electrophiles (0.8 < ω < 1.5 eV), and all were moderate nucleophiles (2.0 eV ≤ N ≤ 3.0 eV). ADMET analysis showed all Apratoxins display good gastrointestinal absorption but no BBB permeability. All could act as P-gp substrates and P-gp I inhibitors. Bioactivity scores indicated all members (except F and G) would behave as protease inhibitors, and Apratoxins A, B, C and E could act as GPCR ligands. None showed AMES toxicity but all exhibited hepatotoxicity. All showed negative behavior as hERG I and II inhibitors except Apratoxin F for hERG II inhibition.",
  "conclusions": "Through combination of Conceptual DFT reactivity descriptors, validation of Janak and Ionization Energy theorems, and cheminformatics tools for pharmacokinetic parameters and ADMET indices, information regarding potential therapeutic properties of marine cyclopeptides has been reported. The results provide basis and starting point for future experimental and clinical research concerning these molecules. These conclusions pave the way for considering Conceptual DFT reactivity indices as descriptors of bioactivity in future studies employing larger numbers of potential therapeutic drugs.",

  "title": "Bitter peptide prediction using graph neural networks",
  "abstract": "Bitter taste is an unpleasant taste modality that affects food consumption. Bitter peptides are generated during enzymatic processes that produce functional, bioactive protein hydrolysates or during the aging process of fermented products such as cheese, soybean protein, and wine. Understanding the underlying peptide sequences responsible for bitter taste can pave the way for more efficient identification of these peptides. This paper presents BitterPep-GCN, a feature-agnostic graph convolution network for bitter peptide prediction. The graph-based model learns the embedding of amino acids in the bitter peptide sequences and uses mixed pooling for bitter classification. BitterPep-GCN was benchmarked using BTP640, a publicly available bitter peptide dataset. The latent peptide embeddings generated by the trained model were used to analyze the activity of sequence motifs responsible for the bitter taste of the peptides. Particularly, we calculated the activity for individual amino acids and dipeptide, tripeptide, and tetrapeptide sequence motifs present in the peptides. Our analyses pinpoint specific amino acids, such as F, G, P, and R, as well as sequence motifs, notably tripeptide and tetrapeptide motifs containing FF, as key bitter signatures in peptides. This work not only provides a new predictor of bitter taste for a more efficient identification of bitter peptides in various food products but also gives a hint into the molecular basis of bitterness.",
  "keywords": ["Peptides", "Representation learning", "Bitter taste", "Food"],
  "methods": "The BTP640 bitter peptide dataset comprises 320 experimentally confirmed bitter peptide sequences and 320 non-bitter peptides. Peptides are represented as graphs G(N, E), where amino acids are nodes N and bonds between them are edges E. One-Hot encoding scheme represents different amino acids as 20-dimensional vectors. Three different types of GNNs were used: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), and GraphSAGE. The architecture has a node embedding module with three hidden layers for learning latent properties of amino acids and a pooling module for extracting peptide graph-level embedding. Two pooling schemes were used: meanpool and mixedpool. The models were benchmarked using 10-fold cross-validation strategy, with the dataset divided into ten subsets of 64 peptides each. For interpretation, peptide embeddings were transformed into 2D using t-SNE and clustered using K-means. Importance scores were calculated by averaging the output of all occurrences of substructures in peptides. Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to provide visual explanations for model decisions.",
  "results": "Six BitterPep-GNN models were tested combining three GNN types with two pooling modules. BitterPep-GCN showed superior performance with highest average 10-fold accuracy. BitterPep-GCN-Mixedpool achieved the best performance with average 10-fold accuracy of 0.86, top fold accuracy of 0.95, average ROC of 0.89, and top fold ROC of 0.98. The models achieved comparable results to existing methods but did not outperform them. Peptide space visualization using t-SNE revealed four clusters with different ratios of bitter and non-bitter peptides. Cluster 4 had highest percentage of bitter peptides (121 bitter vs 2 non-bitter). Analysis showed low correlation between BitterPep-GCN predictions and Q values (hydrophobicity measure). Individual amino acid analysis identified F, G, P, and R as key contributors to bitter taste, while A, C, M, N, Q, S, and T were associated with non-bitter peptides. Dipeptide motifs with high scores included VD, ID, DV, VV, EE, FF, WP, FP, GF and GR. The most significant sequence motifs were tripeptide and tetrapeptide motifs containing FF, which were exclusively present in bitter peptides.",
  "conclusions": "BitterPep-GCN provides a feature-agnostic graph convolution network for bitter peptide prediction that achieves comparable performance to existing methods while offering interpretability advantages. The model successfully identifies specific amino acids (F, G, P, R) and sequence motifs (particularly FF-containing motifs) as key bitter signatures. The graph-based approach handles variable sequence lengths and captures long-range dependencies without requiring pre-calculated features. The model's interpretability through embedding analysis and Grad-CAM visualization provides insights into the molecular basis of bitterness. However, current limitations include scarcity of sensory-proofed data and absence of taste threshold information, suggesting future efforts should focus on generating high-quality experimental data.",

  "title": "Assessing the efficacy of cinnamon compounds against H. pylori through molecular docking, MD Simulations and ADMET analyses",
  "abstract": "Antibiotics are the drugs that are used for the management of microbial diseases. However, these conventional synthetic drugs can harmfully affect the human health. Since phytochemicals are extracted from natural sources and, are hence relatively safer for human health, they are the enticing alternatives in this regard. Cinnamon is also one of those plants which is being employed as herbal medication for centuries against certain microbial infections due its significant therapeutic effectiveness. A well-known pathogenic bacterium called H. pylori causes a wide range of illnesses in human body. This pathogen's pathogenicity is determined by certain virulent proteins. In this study, some of such proteins, which included virB4, virB8, and virB9 were selected to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of cinnamon compounds. These proteins were identified in different isolates of H. pylori. The structural modelling of all these proteins were performed initially in order to proceed them for molecular docking analysis. While, the docking studies illustrated that one of the cinnamon compounds, cinnamyl acetate, showed significant binding interactions with virB4 and virB9. However, benzyl benzoate which is another cinnamon compound, docked well with virB8. Afterwards, the MD simulations were incorporated to explore the interaction motions and structural stability of all the docked complexes. In this regard, the resultant maps of Bfactor, eigenvalues and elastic network model, among other factors ensured the structural stabilities of all the respective complexes. After these crucial estimations, benzyl benzoate and cinnamyl acetate underwent the ADMET investigation to assess their pharmacokinetic characteristics. SwissADME and ADMETLab 2.0 server were employed for this investigation. The compiled findings these servers revealed that both, benzyl benzoate and cinnamyl acetate, exhibited a significant level of pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness conformity.",
