I'll analyze the new paper and update the literature review by integrating its content into the existing review. Let me first examine the paper to understand its key findings and relevance to the ADMET prediction tools research.

The new paper "Machine learning and molecular dynamics reveal anti-osteoporosis potential of dietary flavonoids" is highly relevant to our literature review as it demonstrates a practical application of machine learning algorithms and ADMET analysis in drug discovery, specifically for identifying potential anti-osteoporosis compounds from dietary flavonoids.

Let me update the literature review by integrating this new information:
