It integrates three custom tools: AWS Service Knowledge Base for service information and mapping, Architecture Diagram Generator for creating visual diagrams, and Architecture Validator for ensuring architectures follow AWS best practices. The agent is configured to use the Claude 3 Opus model for advanced reasoning capabilities, allowing it to understand complex requirements and map them to appropriate AWS services. The development process focused on creating a user-friendly agent that can generate accurate, well-designed AWS architectures with clear explanations of design decisions. The agent supports multiple diagram formats and can handle various levels of detail in requirements."
