# Project Development Summary

## Project Overview
The News Retrieval Agent project has successfully developed an intelligent agent capable of retrieving hot news based on user topics of interest from multiple mainstream media platforms including Baidu, Sina, ThePaper, and others. The agent provides news aggregation, heat-based sorting, and summary generation capabilities to help users stay informed about their topics of interest without information overload.

## Development Process Summary

### Requirements Analysis
The requirements analysis phase identified key functional needs including:
- User topic management (add, view, delete topics)
- Multi-platform news retrieval from mainstream media
- News heat calculation and sorting
- News summary generation
- User-friendly interaction interface

Non-functional requirements included performance constraints (response time under 5 seconds), security considerations (compliance with platform APIs), and reliability (99% system availability).

### System Architecture
The system was designed with a single-agent architecture based on the deep_research_agent template. Key architectural decisions included:
- HTTP request tools for accessing various news platform APIs
- Local storage for user topic management
- LLM-based news summary generation
- Asynchronous requests to multiple platforms for improved performance

### Agent Design
The agent was designed as a "News Retrieval and Aggregation Expert" with:
- Professional, efficient, objective, service-oriented personality
- Core capabilities for topic management, news retrieval, heat calculation, and summary generation
- Clear interaction patterns for handling user requests
- Robust error handling for platform unavailability and network issues

### Tools Development
Four primary tools were developed:
1. **news_fetcher**: Retrieves news from multiple platforms with error handling
2. **heat_calculator**: Calculates and sorts news by popularity based on read count, comments, and publish time
3. **summary_generator**: Generates concise news summaries
4. **topic_manager**: Manages user topics with local storage

### Prompt Engineering
A comprehensive prompt template was created that:
- Establishes the agent's role and personality
- Provides clear instructions for using the available tools
- Guides the agent in responding to user requests
- Includes error handling protocols
- Defines output formatting standards

### Agent Code Development
The agent code was implemented with:
- Integration of all developed tools
- Core functionality implementation
- Error handling for various scenarios
- Clear, structured news output formatting
- Documentation and usage examples

## Project Deliverables

1. **Tools**:
   - news_fetcher.py
   - heat_calculator.py
   - summary_generator.py
   - topic_manager.py

2. **Prompt Template**:
   - news_agent_prompt.txt

3. **Agent Code**:
   - news_agent.py

## Usage Guide

### Starting the Agent
```python
from news_agent import NewsAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = NewsAgent()

# Start interaction
agent.start()
```

### Managing Topics
```
# Add a topic
> add topic "artificial intelligence"

# View all topics
> show topics

# Delete a topic
> delete topic "artificial intelligence"
```

### Retrieving News
```
# Get news for a specific topic
> get news about "climate change"

# Get news for all followed topics
> get latest news

# Get more news for current topic
> show more news
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Limited to text-based interaction
- No historical news archiving
- No personalized news recommendations
- No complex sentiment analysis

### Future Improvements
- Add support for more news platforms
- Implement news categorization by topic
- Develop a graphical user interface
- Add personalized news recommendation features
- Implement historical news archiving and trends analysis

## Conclusion
The News Retrieval Agent project has successfully delivered a functional agent that meets all the specified requirements. The agent provides an efficient way for users to stay updated on their topics of interest by aggregating news from multiple mainstream media sources, sorting by popularity, and providing concise summaries. The modular design allows for future extensions and improvements.
