  "analysis_notes": "The PubMed Literature Search and Summarization Agent is evaluated as a single-agent system because its functionality, while comprehensive, follows a clear linear workflow from data retrieval to report generation. The agent's tasks are focused on a specific domain (PMC literature) with well-defined input/output relationships. While the system performs multiple functions (search, filter, rank, extract, report), these are closely related aspects of a unified literature processing pipeline rather than distinct specialized roles requiring multi-agent coordination. The data analysis agent type is recommended due to the system's focus on retrieving, processing, and analyzing structured data from the PMC repository. The key technical challenge lies in efficiently integrating with AWS S3 to access PMC data and implementing effective relevance ranking algorithms. The agent's value proposition centers on dramatically reducing literature review time while ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant research."
