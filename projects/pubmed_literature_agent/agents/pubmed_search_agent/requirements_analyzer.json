  "analysis_notes": "This project is well-suited for a single-agent implementation as it focuses on a specific domain (PubMed literature) with a clear workflow: query processing, literature retrieval, content extraction, summarization, and structured presentation. The main technical challenges involve effective query optimization for PubMed, accurate relevance ranking, and high-quality summary generation. The agent will need to interface with the PubMed/NCBI API and handle potential limitations such as rate limits and access restrictions. While the core functionality is straightforward, the quality of results will depend heavily on sophisticated NLP capabilities for query understanding and content summarization. The recommended agent type is a Data Analysis and Information Retrieval Agent, as it combines search functionality with content analysis and structured information presentation."
