  "design_rationale": "The system architecture is designed as a single-agent solution based on the requirements analysis, which indicated a focused workflow with clear sequential steps: query processing, literature retrieval, content extraction, summary generation, and results presentation. The Deep Research Agent template was selected as the primary foundation because it already includes many of the required capabilities for comprehensive information gathering and analysis, with additional patterns borrowed from the API Integration Agent template for effective PubMed API interaction.\n\nA single-agent architecture was chosen over a multi-agent approach because the workflow is linear and cohesive, with each step building directly on the previous one. This approach simplifies development, testing, and maintenance while still allowing for modularity through well-defined internal components.\n\nThe data models are designed to capture the complete flow of information from initial user query through to final results presentation, with clear validation rules to ensure data integrity throughout the process. The interaction flows define both the happy path for successful searches and specific error handling paths to ensure robustness.\n\nThe architecture incorporates several performance optimizations, including caching and parallel processing, to meet the non-functional requirements for response time. Security considerations focus on compliance with PubMed's terms of service and appropriate handling of user data. The monitoring strategy ensures that system health and performance can be tracked over time for continuous improvement.\n\nThis design provides a solid foundation for implementing a PubMed literature search and analysis agent that delivers relevant, well-summarized medical literature to users efficiently and effectively."
